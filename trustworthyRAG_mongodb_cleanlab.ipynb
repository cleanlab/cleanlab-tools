    "Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally hallucinate incorrect answers, especially for questions not well-supported within their training data. While organizations are rapidly adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to pair the power of LLMs with their own proprietary data, hallucinated/incorrect RAG responses remain a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a solution to build **trustworthy** RAG applications using MongoDB and Cleanlab to mitigate hallucinated/incorrect responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cleanlab](https://help.cleanlab.ai/tlm/) boosts the reliability of any LLM application by scoring when LLM responses are untrusworthy. Trust scoring happens in real-time and does not require any data labeling or model training work. Cleanlab provides additional real-time Evals for other RAG components like the retrieved context, which help you diagnose *why* certain RAG responses and inaccurate/bad. Cleanlab's detection enables you to automatically flag/prevent inaccurate/bad responses from your RAG app, and avoid losing your users' trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB streamlines RAG application development, providing a scalable vector database to store your organization's knowledge. By providing all of the necessary components via a simple developer experience, MongoDB enables you to quickly deploy a performant RAG application. Adding Cleanlab on top provides an additional layer of trust."
