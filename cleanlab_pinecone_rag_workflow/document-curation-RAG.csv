Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. If you require operator assistance at any time, please press star zero. If would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you use your speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.Weston Tucker: Thank you, Katie, and good morning and welcome to Blackstone's third quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO, Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks. I'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the risk factors section of our 10-K We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations on the shareholders’ page of our website.Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audio cast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.On results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $921 million. Distributable earnings were $1.2 billion, or $0.94 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.80, which will be paid to holders of record as of October 30th.With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.Steve Schwarzman: Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the recent events in Israel. We were shocked by the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred, which are an affront to our shared human values, and we are deeply saddened by the violence and tragic loss of life unfolding in the region. Our thoughts are with the people of Israel, our colleagues there, and all of those enduring pain and hardship throughout the region.Turning to our results – the third quarter of 2023 was a volatile period for global markets, including a dramatic increase in bond yields. Most major equity indices have declined, and the median US stock is negative on a year-to-year basis. Higher interest rates, along with a confluence of other factors, including economic uncertainty, geopolitical turbulence, high fiscal deficits, political dysfunction, and labor unrest have adversely impacted investor sentiment. Today's environment is an extremely challenging one for investors to navigate. Against this backdrop, Blackstone generated distributable earnings of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, which were stable with the second quarter. The environment today is less favorable for realizations, so we've chosen to sell less.But the firm's underlying earnings power continues to build, and we remain focused on executing the operating plans for our companies and driving the long-term value of our holdings. Our limited partners continue to benefit from the favorable positioning of our portfolio, with resilient fundamentals in the sectors where we’ve focused, which Jon will discuss further. The result is that nearly all of our flagship strategies outperformed market indices in the third quarter, as they have for nearly 40 years.1The firm's global scale gives us deep insights into what's happening in the real economy, which inform how we position the firm and construct our portfolios amid changing conditions. We've been saying consistently that we believe the Fed will keep rates higher for longer, and we didn't share the previous consensus view that they would cut rates by the end of this year. What we are seeing in the data, an economy that's strong today, but decelerating. We also see that significant progress is being made on inflation, perhaps more so than other market participants, based on the movement in bond yields recently. In our portfolio, we estimate input costs were largely flat year over year. Wage growth is moderating and job openings are declining. While it will take time, we believe the collective weight central bank actions will bring about the intended effect of cooling the economy, leading to the conditions for a more accommodative Fed stance and eventual easing of the cost of capital.Meanwhile, Blackstone's unique diversity and breadth, with over 70 distinct investment strategies, position us extremely well to navigate any environment. The balance of our firm allows us to pivot to where we see the greatest opportunities at a given point in a cycle. For example, our credit businesses are thriving today in the context of a very favorable operating environment given higher base rates along with challenges to traditional lenders. Investment performance has been outstanding, including 14.4% appreciation over the last 12 months in our private credit strategies and 4.6% just in the third quarter. Unsurprisingly, client demand in this area is accelerating across all channels; institutional, insurance, and individuals.In keeping pace with this evolving opportunity, we recently announced the integration of our corporate credit, asset-backed finance, and insurance groups into a single new unit, BXCI. We expect this integration will create a more seamless experience for clients and borrowers, allowing us to offer a one- stop solution across corporate and asset-based private credit, including both investment-grade and non- investment-grade. We believe these changes will further accelerate growth, and that BXCI and real estate credit collectively could grow AUM from approximately $370 billion today to $1 trillion within the next 10 years, given the powerful secular tailwinds and strength of our platform.In addition to credit and insurance, we are seeing compelling near-term dynamics in several other areas where Blackstone has established leading businesses, such as infrastructure, notably including digital infrastructure, energy transition, and life sciences. The private wealth channel also remains a tremendous long-term opportunity for the firm. Jon will discuss the positive developments in these areas in more detail.Overall, limited partners continue to move away from the traditional 60-40 liquid portfolio, and despite market headwinds, they are allocating more capital to the best alternative managers across more asset classes.Blackstone is extremely well-positioned to capture future opportunities for growth in the alternatives area, which remains early in its long-term development. We are the reference institution among global LPs, a position that has been continually reinforced across market cycles of nearly 40 years. We have led the industry's evolution, and I expect we will continue to lead it in the future. Last month, we were gratified that S&P Dow Jones chose Blackstone as the first major alternative manager to be included in the S&P 500, the largest benchmark index, and the last one that Blackstone was not yet a part of following our conversion to a corporation in 2019. This milestone is a further reflection of the firm's leadership position in our industry and the broader market, as well as our progression as a valuable and widely owned public company.Most importantly, we've continued to generate exceptional long-term results for both our fund investors and our shareholders. This is our mission. It's what drives us forward as a firm. While the market environment will undoubtedly present challenges, it’ll also provide opportunities we are well-positioned2to capitalize upon with over $200 billion of dry powder. These are the times that best highlight the distinctiveness of our firm and the enduring nature of our culture. Everyone at Blackstone is completely focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jon.Jon Gray: Thank you, Steve. And good morning, everyone. The investment performance we've consistently produced over decades has created a huge reservoir of goodwill with our customers, allowing us to grow, even in difficult periods. Meanwhile, our platform expansion provides multiple ways to win for them across market cycles. And as Steve noted, virtually all customer channels are increasing their allocations to alternatives over time, many in a material way. These key pillars give me great confidence in the future of Blackstone, starting with investment performance. Our funds generated positive appreciation overall in the third quarter, compared to declines in nearly all major market indices, with significant strength in private credit, infrastructure, and life sciences. Against a backdrop where the cost of capital has risen considerably, it is critical to own high-quality businesses with secular tailwinds or assets that benefit from higher rates, like floating-rate credit.In real estate, Blackstone is in an extremely differentiated position. The majority of the equity portfolio is in logistics, data centers, and student housing, which continue to benefit from robust fundamentals. Our data center business, QTS, held in BREIT, BPP, and our infrastructure vehicle, was the single largest source of appreciation at the firm, driven by explosive growth in data creation that is being accelerated by the AI revolution. Since privatizing the company two years ago, lease capacity has grown six-fold with the development pipeline pre-leased to major tech companies. And we are evaluating additional deployment opportunities in the space.In logistics, the firm's largest exposure overall, trends remain favorable, with releasing spreads in our US warehouses of over 60% in recent months. And similarly, strong dynamics in many of our other major logistics markets globally. At the same time, market rents continue to move higher. In certain other areas of the portfolio, including our US apartment buildings, we're seeing moderation in growth, but cash flows are stable or increasing across the vast majority of our real estate holdings. That said, higher interest rates are impacting valuation multiples in the sector. This is also having the effect of meaningfully reducing the new supply pipeline, which is favorable for values longer term. Construction starts are falling sharply for virtually all types of real estate, including year-over-year declines of 30% to 70% for US apartment buildings, warehouses, and hotels. And in the dislocated market, having $66 billion of dry powder and real estate is a significant advantage.In corporate private equity, our operating companies reported resilient, high single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter, with strong margin performance, as cost pressures continue to abate. In credit, the increase in base rates has been very positive for our clients. Today, we can originate high-quality senior loans with all-in yields of over 12% at sub-40% loan loan-to-value ratios. Meanwhile, our existing portfolio is stable and default rates remain historically low at under 50 basis points for our non- investment-grade holdings. In our investment-grade credit portfolio, in 2023, we've delivered 140 basis points of excess spread to our major insurance clients while materially improving credit quality.And finally, BAAM had its 14th consecutive quarter of positive performance for the BPS composite. Since the start of 2021, BAAM has achieved a 17% cumulative composite net return compared to a 2% decline in the 60/40 portfolio, equating to exceptional outperformance in liquid markets.The strength of our returns and the breadth of our firm allow us to continue raising significant capital in a very difficult fundraising environment. Total inflows were $25 billion in the third quarter and $139 billion over the past 12 months. The greatest demand today is for private credit solutions, as Steve discussed, and our credit, insurance, and real estate credit businesses comprised over 50% of total inflows again in the third quarter. In the insurance channel, our major clients allocated $5 billion to us in the quarter, bringing3AUM to $178 billion with a promising pipeline of additional prospects. We also finished raising our energy transition private credit fund, BGREEN, with the strategy reaching $7.5 billion, the largest of its kind in the world. And in the individual channel, BCRED, raised $2.5 billion in the third quarter, up 36% from Q2 on the back of strong performance.Outside of credit, other major fund closings in the third quarter included our European real estate flagship, which has raised over €4 billion to date. Over half of our investment activity in real estate this year has been in Europe given greater dislocation and pressure on sellers in the region.We also raised $1.2 billion in tactical opportunities, $1.1 billion for secondaries vehicles, and an additional $500 million for our corporate private equity flagship.We previously highlighted several other growth avenues with favorable momentum. We've been innovating and planting seeds in these areas, which have now blossomed into major businesses at Blackstone. Our infrastructure platform has grown to $40 billion in only five years, including 28% growth in the last 12 months. Performance has been extraordinary, with 17% net returns annually since inception for our BIP vehicle. Given the immense funding needs for infrastructure projects globally and our performance, we believe this could be a $100 billion business over time. Key areas of focus include digital infrastructure, such as QTS, along with the energy transition. BIP's largest investment in Q3 was a wind and solar portfolio from AEP, which is part of a broader renewable asset strategy. Other significant investments by the firm recently in energy transition include additional capital in the nation's largest private renewables developer, and a stake in a major US utility to support its transition to green energy.And in credit, we committed $600 million in Q3 to a platform we're building to provide preferred equity financing to leading renewable companies. With BIP and our dedicated credit and private equity energy transition vehicles, we are extremely well positioned to benefit from the massive tailwinds in this rapidly growing sector. In life sciences, our BXSL business had a terrific quarter, and is experiencing strong momentum. Our funds appreciated 11.7% with notable positive developments for several life-saving medications and technologies, including an anticoagulant drug to help prevent strokes, a treatment for hypertension, and a next generation implantable defibrillator. We're also actively deploying capital, most recently to help fund a leading biotech firm focused on treatments for rare diseases. We plan to start raising our next life in our next Life Sciences flagship vehicle early next year.Finally, in private wealth, we raised $3.3 billion in our perpetual vehicles in the third quarter, led by BCRED. For BREIT, while sales remain muted due to the environment at $724 million, repurchase requests have declined materially, down nearly 30% from Q2 and nearly 60% from the January peak. BREIT's largest share class has delivered 12% net return since inception approximately seven years ago, nearly four times the public REIT index. Meanwhile, all investors that have been submitting repurchase requests during the proration period have been substantially redeemed in six months or less. BREIT's semi-liquid vehicle has worked exactly as intended, by providing liquidity for investors in a deliberate and thoughtful way, while protecting performance. Blackstone has established the largest private wealth alternatives platform in the world. Now, in addition to our perpetual strategies in real estate and credit, we're extending our leading franchise to include private equity with the launch of a new perpetual vehicle, BXPE. This diversified vehicle will leverage the firm's unique breadth of investment capabilities across the PE spectrum, including buyout, secondaries, tactical opportunities, life sciences and other opportunistic strategies. We are working with several distributors and expect inflows to start early next year. We're excited to add this new vehicle to our product lineup and remain optimistic about our long- term growth trajectory in this vast and underpenetrated channel.In closing, despite the market's near-term challenges, we remain focused on delivering for our investors over the long-term. We are executing our asset-light, brand-heavy strategy with minimal net debt and no4insurance liabilities. And we have powerful momentum across a multitude of growth channels of enormous size. With that, I will turn things over to Michael.Michael Chae: Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. The headline for the firm's financial performance in the third quarter is stability amid a challenging external operating environment. Despite executing fewer sales in less favorable markets, we are generating a consistent and attractive baseline of earnings and dividends for shareholders. Meanwhile, we continue to expand the foundation of the firm's earnings power across multiple drivers of growth.Starting with results. As Steve and Jon highlighted, the firm's extraordinary breadth has supported continued growth in AUM despite the broader market declines. Total AUM increased 6% year over year, Moving beyond the $1 trillion milestone, led by 10% growth in the credit and insurance sector. Fee AUM rose 4% to a record $735 billion, driving base management fees up 6% to $1.6 billion, reflecting the 55th consecutive quarter of year-over-year base management fee growth at Blackstone. Fee-related earnings were $1.1 billion in the third quarter, or $0.92 per share, largely stable with Q2, underpinned by steady top-line performance, along with the firm's strong margin position. The year-over-year comparison was affected by a decline in transaction fees, which are activity-based, as well as lower fee-related performance revenues. Notwithstanding these headwinds, the firm generated $275 million of fee-related performance revenues in the third quarter across multiple perpetual vehicles and real estate credit, notably reflecting a growing contribution from BCRED along with the material year-over-year increase from the BPP platform.Distributable earnings were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, or $0.94 per share, again stable with Q2. On a year-over-year basis, net realizations declined given the market backdrop. However, we did execute the sales of public stock in the London Stock Exchange Group and our stake in an India-based software company, along with certain other holdings in private equity. Realizations also included a significant sale in BREIT, which, as a reminder, does not earn performance revenues based on individual asset sales, but on NAV, subject to a hurdle. The sale was of a self-storage company for $2.2 billion, one of the largest- ever transactions in the sector, which generated a profit of over $600 million and a gross multiple of invested capital of 1.8x in less than three years. BREIT's asset sales since the beginning of last year, when interest rates began-began moving materially higher, have occurred at an average premium to their prior carrying value of 4%. Overall, we've been highly selective in terms of realizations, and activity is likely to remain muted in the near term, given the environment. But the firm's FRE continues to provide real ballast to earnings, and Q3 represented the eighth consecutive quarter of FRE over $1 billion.Meanwhile, our long-term fund structures let us focus on building value in the portfolio while we wait for market conditions to improve. Performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground increased in third quarter to a record $505 billion and has nearly doubled in the past three years. Net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet, the firm's store of value, stands at $6.4 billion, or $5.29 per share. We hold an expansive portfolio of exceptional quality and embedded value, including $16 billion of public stock in our private equity and real estate drawdown funds. When markets ultimately become more receptive, we are well-positioned for an acceleration and realization activity as well.Moving to the outlook, we remain highly confident in the multi-year expansion of the firm's earning power and FRE, with several embedded growth drivers. First, in our drawdown fund business, we've raised nearly 80% of our $150 billion target, but less than half was earning management fees at quarter end. We launched the investment period for the new European real estate flagship in September, which will earn management fees after an effective four-month fee holiday for first closers. Over the next several quarters, subject to deployment, we expect to activate the new flagships in corporate private equity, private equity energy transition, growth equity and infrastructure secondaries, followed by their respective fee holidays. Second, our platform of perpetual strategies has continued to expand, including5BCRED, which generates fee-related performance revenues quarterly based on investment income, and our BIP infrastructure vehicle with its next crystallization scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024 with respect to three years of gains. Third, in the insurance area, AUM has reached $178 billion as Jon noted, up 18% year-over-year, driven by robust inflows from our major clients from whom we anticipate substantial, largely contractual inflows in the years ahead. In closing, the firm's all-weather business model provides resiliency and staying power in difficult markets. Meanwhile, our underlying earnings power continues to build, and we have greater investment firepower than ever before. With multiple growth engines driving us forward, we are well positioned for the future.With that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions.Moderator: Thank you. As a reminder, please press star one to ask a question. We ask you limit yourself to one question to allow as many questions as possible. We’ll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr: Hi. Good morning. I'll try to simplify this because you just went through some of the building blocks for '24 and beyond. But it feels like there has to be a little bit of reset down just because in this environment, performance fees can only be so much. So maybe my key question is if you've had good, strong double-digit FRE growth in the past, can we see double-digit FRE growth in '24 given the building blocks that you just ran through? And maybe a sidebar to that is, can real estate and private equity work in a higher-for-longer rate backdrop, which we seem to be in? Thanks.Michael Chae: Glenn, Thank you for the question. It's Michael. I think on the first one, I think Jon will handle the second. Obviously, at this point, especially for 2024, we're not going to give granular guidance. I would say there are a number of key drivers that certainly inform our view over the long term of sustained double digit FRE growth. In the nearer term, I think it's really important, the point that I spent time on in my remarks, which is the idea that management fee revenues, which were stable quarter over quarter, really have an underlying ramp based on activation of a number of these funds, that will be a tailwind for our top line growth. And so as I said, $150 billion flagship fundraising cycle, as we've talked about, nearly 80% raised and less than half, about 45%, earning management fees as of the end of the quarter. We expect that percentage to move up to a substantial majority of that total amount in the coming quarters by sort of the middle of next year. So that is a built-in thing. And the reason why, if you step back again, why that ramp has been somewhat slower than maybe was expected a couple years ago is because of market conditions and deployment because basically in a lower deployment environment, in the context of these markets, the investment periods last all else equal longer for the predecessor funds and the launch of the new funds are delayed. So the money is substantially there from a fundraising standpoint. From a management fee earnings standpoint, it will come on as these funds launch, as after fee holidays as is the case with the European fund. I think on fee related performance revenues, you know, if you step back, I highlighted the credit fee related performance revenues. If you look in the segment financials, those were up in the credit segment, 31% in third quarter, 57% in the nine months year to date. So there's real expansion going on there. And as you know, that earns incentive fees every quarter on the NAV base based on investment income, which is a very steady growing source of fees.And then BREIT, we think is a portfolio that is well positioned. And in BPP, we have a scheduled crystallization in the fourth quarter. We have a meaningful amount next year. And then we have a very significant, as I mentioned, scheduled crystallization on infrastructure in the fourth quarter of next year. That is a fund that's appreciated 17% net historically, and we'll have another five quarters of gains built into whatever the ultimate incentive fee is late next year. So, I would just give as the framing for the underlying earnings power, that we certainly see is very much intact long term and in the nearer term and next year, there's significant, I think, underlying momentum.6Jon Gray: Well, I'll just add, Glenn, to your question on can the firm operate in real estate and private equity maybe more broadly in a higher rate environment. And I would just point to over decades this firm has delivered for customers in higher rate environments and lower rate environments. And the reason is what we do at our core is what creates the incremental return. So if you buy a business or asset, you improve the management, you allocate capital in the right way, you can generate higher returns even if borrowing costs are higher. And so we have a lot of confidence that we can do that. The other thing I would point out is when you get to an environment of higher rates, as we're seeing on the screen, asset prices can come down. So your entry point in a higher rate environment allows you to set up transactions better over time as rates come back down. Maybe you then see some more multiple expansion. So there's more opportunities for deployment. And I would also add that at a moment like this, dislocation comes about. And so when you're sitting on $201 billion of dry powder, there can be situations where people need to raise capital in a hurry, need to sell something quickly. And again, that's advantageous for our model. Because if you think about what we do, we're not forced sellers of assets on the one side, and yet we have the ability to move very quickly when there is dislocation to take advantage of an opportunity. And then more broadly, a bunch of our capital solutions businesses related to private credit, certainly, tactical opportunities, which I think will be super helpful in people deleveraging their portfolios, our secondaries business, which provides liquidity as well – they're well positioned in this environment. So the environment changes, we move from low rates to high rates, but it doesn't mean the basic business of delivering better returns has gone away. And the client's desire for this continues to be extremely high.Glenn Schorr: Thank you both for all that.Moderator: We'll go next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.Michael Cyprys: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to elaborate on the deployment and realization environment activity. It seemed like activity levels were starting to pick up in August, but then slowed a bit in September as yields went higher. So what will it take for the green shoots that we were seeing just a couple of months ago to convert to sustained capital markets activity? And if current levels of rates persist for the next year or two, what sort of impact might that have broadly on activity levels, perhaps in forced sales and real estate, but also what sort of impact might higher rates have on the broader system and the potential for credit losses?Jon Gray: Okay, Mike, there's a lot embedded there. Let me go on-on transaction activity, it's not a surprise when you see in the third quarter and now in the fourth quarter, long rates moving as rapidly as they are, that market participants pause. And you see a suppressing of transaction volume. And we've seen this in the past in moments of market volatility and instability. And so, until you get some settling out of that, I think it will mute the transaction activity on all sides. I think the positives here are the Fed, I believe, is pretty close to done. We believe that based on the progress they're making against inflation. Also, the long end, I think, will start to do a fair amount of work for them as it drives up mortgage rates, as it drives up consumer loans like auto loans. And so, I think getting stability in the rate environment, starting with the Fed on the short end, and some settling here on the long end will be important. What’s important to remember of course, is there is cyclicality to the transaction environment, but there's ultimately underlying demand for people to buy and sell businesses. Could be a company that needs to sell a division. Could be a family. Could be somebody who needs to refinance because of a maturity. And you look back over the long history of the firm, again, over four decades, there are periods, certainly after the financial crisis, where things were slow. Very slow for a few weeks, of course, during COVID. You can go back to other periods of time. But eventually, it comes back because people need to transact. So, it's hard to put a date on this, but I would say, as a predicate for transaction activity to pick up, you want to see a little bit of settling of rates. If we get that, I do think you will. Our pipelines and our various businesses actually are reasonable today. We've got some transactions we're doing. It's certainly not an elevated level, but I do think we need a little I think we need a little settling in the environment. And so, I7would say, we have extremely high long-term confidence that there'll be plenty of opportunities to deploy the capital we've raised. It's very hard to put your finger on exactly when that's going to happen.You also asked about the, I guess, the financial system and so forth. Whenever you have sharp movements, that does create some additional risk. So far, we haven't seen anything out there. But there are incremental risks, given the sharp movement we've seen in rates. I think that the Fed and the fiscal authorities did a good job in March handling that banking issue. It's hard to predict where the next spot may be. The good news is, the underlying US economy has shown remarkable resilience. That's provided some balance. And then I would say the financial system overall, is so much less leveraged than what we experienced in the ‘06, ‘07 period. Consumers don't have nearly the same kind of leverage they did in housing, businesses are so much less leveraged. So there's always a risk that something, there could be some bump out there, but the system just is healthier as we go into this more dislocated time in the market.Michael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate the thoughts.Moderator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.Alex Blostein: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question as well. Jon, I'd love to get your perspective on the impact this higher interest rate environment is going to have on investment performance and portfolio marks, especially into year-end in real estate and private equity as kind of higher discount rates get reflected, or, maybe the flip coin, some of the higher rates already reflected in your assumptions. So just try to get a better sense of like, is there another sort of leg down based on the 10-year having done what it’s done, or the works in the marks is largely behind you guys?Jon Gray: Well, Alex, obviously things are fluid, the 10-year has moved a fair amount in the last month or so, but we, the good thing about our businesses is as background has been how we position the portfolios. We said here in the remarks that our private equity portfolio had 8% revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter, which was obviously quite positive. In real estate, our positioning majority of our portfolio that we own in logistics, in student housing and data centers has made a big difference for us. Faster growth allows you to absorb a higher rate environment, but no one's immune. It's hard to predict where things are going to sit a couple months from now, what's going to happen over time. Higher rates do have an impact across valuations, but obviously there's an interplay with cash flow. So, I certainly don't want to get in the business of predicting what it's going to be. But this is a headwind out there in markets, and you're seeing it on the screen right now.Alex Blostein: All right. Thank you.Moderator: We'll go next to Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.Craig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Steve, Jon. Thanks for taking my question.Jon Gray: Go ahead.Craig Siegenthaler: So if we take the last question and we look a little bit further out, most economists are expecting the US economy to weaken next year, and most bond investors are forecasting rising defaults broadly. So, I wanted your perspective on how you think this will impact private asset returns, especially in private credit and real estate, and could this lead to more investing opportunities next year at Blackstone?8Jon Gray: Well, I think it's reasonable to assume if you have elevated levels of rates and you have the economy slow down, that that puts more pressure, and I think most market forecasters are anticipating higher default rates in various sectors. I would say that we're starting off of very low default rates today. I mean, in our private credit portfolio, less than half of 1% in our BCRED vehicle. I think we have just one asset that's on non-accrual. So we certainly are starting off in a very good spot. Overall, if you talk to the banks, you guys are closer to that. I think default rates are fairly low. They're starting to pick up a little bit in subprime, but I think it is reasonable to assume there's going to be more pressure. In real estate, certainly in some of the most challenged asset classes, I think we'll see higher default rates, the cost of capital and less availability will have an impact. And having this large pool of capital, that huge amounts of dry powder really in almost every part of the firm should help us a lot. And one of my partners, Kathleen McCarthy, said this is when we do our best work. And I think that's a good description, that when there's high uncertainty, people need capital in a hurry, and you're willing to take a longer-term view on asset values and normalization, you can step-in in these times and make attractive investments. So, yeah, when we think about what makes us enthusiastic, having this large pool of capital with some more pressure out there, that should create opportunities. But overall, we would go into this environment with the financial system and default rates pretty healthy at this point.Michael Chae: Thank you, Craig. It’s Michael. I’d just add to that, that, and this is particularly focused on a private credit, non-investment-grade portfolio, that we're talking about quite low loans-to-value against a very healthy portfolio today, quite performing portfolio today. So, as you know in our direct lending area, the average loan-to-value of this portfolio that we've built over the last few years, is around 40%. So when you just, and the underlying companies in quite good position, supported by very supportive financial sponsors in many cases. And so, when you think about even a rising default rate from a very low starting point, as Jon mentioned, against anything resembling sort of historical recovery values on a theoretical basis, and then you combine that with sort of the total return available right now in the private credit area with those portfolios, and I think that performance can absorb what may come from our point of view.Craig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Michael.Moderator: We'll take our next question from Finian O’Shea with Wells Fargo Securities.Finian O’Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. A question on retail. Can you talk about the potential for BXPE, given it's formatted as a private offering. Can it be distributed as broadly as, say, BREIT and BCRED, or is it meant for different market channels? Thank you.Jon Gray: So, I'm not sure how much we can talk about the description of these individual vehicles, but BXPE is structured a little bit differently, which means the universe is a little more limited, but I would say it's still very large. We think the response to this, a more accessible private equity vehicle that offers private equity, secondaries, tactical opportunities, growth, life sciences, opportunistic investments, we think this is going to be very attractive. So, the short answer is yes, a little bit of a different structure, but I think the bigger answer is we think the TAM for this is quite large, and we think this can scale up quite a bit.Weston Tucker: All right, thanks Fin.Moderator: We'll go next to Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.Ken Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Would love an update on the secondaries business – returns here over the last 12 months have trailed just about all other asset classes at Blackstone with the exception of real estate. So maybe first, what's weighing on returns there? And as we9think about the deployment opportunities, is it still really LP-driven, or are we starting to see, I'm sorry, still GP-driven, or are we starting to see more LP activity picking up as well?Jon Gray: Well, I'd start by saying we love our secondaries business. Vern Perry and the team do a terrific job. Structurally, what's happening in that market is alternatives continue to grow, and therefore there's a need for liquidity, and there's a very limited number of players who are invested in, say, 4,000 funds. And so, it leads to this favorable discount and premium you get in terms of return for providing liquidity. Having a $20 billion plus fund is obviously well-timed. We have additional funds in the infrastructure and real estate beyond private equity. But we think we're super well-positioned. The markdowns or the low growth in this space reflects what's happening in underlying private equity portfolios. But if you look at the returns across our various funds, they remain incredibly strong. And there is a lag, of course, where you're looking at funds that are six or nine months old or so. If there were better quarters more recently in private equity, you'll pick those up later. It's not the same real time you're seeing, let's say, in our direct private equity or real estate activities. In terms of transaction activity, I would say the pipeline is starting to build. It will be more LP-driven because distributions have slowed, and in many cases, there's a denominator effect, and they're thinking about ways to open up capacity to commit to new funds, and we think that will lead to more transaction activity. I would say, we've been patient, because we think it's possible the discounts could widen again, and that would be a better timing in terms of entry points. So, it's a business we like a lot. We think the environment should be favorable here, just given the relatively limited amount of capital against what we think is a scale opportunity. And so, we think that business will pick up in activity over time. It may take a little bit as sort of sellers readjust their expectations.Ken Worthington: Great. Thank you very much.Moderator: We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just similar to the deployment outlook question, maybe flipping that around that you answered earlier, flipping that around to fundraising in terms of this environment where it sounds like obviously activity across the board is freezing up a little bit as people watch rates. But how do you see that impacting the fundraising outlook, and if you maybe can contrast a few different segments where it might be slower near-term versus areas where it could be stronger. And I guess certainly in terms of LPs decision making versus retail would play into that.Jon Gray: So, Brian, I think the biggest backdrop to keep in mind is the vast majority of our clients continue to increase their allocation to alternatives across institutional, insurance, and individual investors. And despite the environment, we still see a lot of interest. I've been all around the world in the last six weeks meeting with major clients, and I can't point to one of those meetings where somebody said, hey, I want to reduce my exposure. Now there are some who are saying, I'm more cautious on real estate, or I'm more cautious on growth equity or private equity. But there's obviously a lot of enthusiasm for private credit. Some investors are just starting to move into the infrastructure space or the secondary space. So I think that's the key backdrop. In terms of different channels here, I would say the institutional or pension fund channel is where the allocations are higher. And in some cases, there is a denominator effect. And so fundraising is a little, is certainly tougher. We've talked about that over the previous quarters. It has certainly gotten better since the lows of March. We'll see, given the current environment, what happens. But I feel pretty good about our relationships and our ability to fundraise, even in a difficult period. I would point out European real estate. Given Europe and real estate, the fact that we raised $3 plus billion in the quarter says something powerful about Blackstone. And the fact that we had $25 billion of inflows in this quarter, and $139 billion over the last year, again, says something powerful. So, I think the institutional channel is a little more constrained in this environment, but their desire for10alternatives remains very high. I would say, as you move towards insurance companies, they're in early days of not moving, as we know, to the higher-returning alternatives, but to private investment-grade credit. That is what the opportunity is. It's about providing them higher returns with the same or lower risk, which is what we've been doing for our major insurance clients and for some of the SMAs. We believe we're still in the early stages of that. We think that business can continue to grow significantly with our existing clients and some additional conversations we're having. And then I would say in the individual investor channel, we've talked about this as well, there's $80 plus trillion in that market of individuals around the world with more than $1 million of investable assets. We think they're allocated in the low single-digit percentages to alternatives today. You've seen obviously, the strength in what we've built up with BREIT over time, the strength in BCRED certainly today. We talked a little bit about BXPE. I think there are opportunities around the world, and I think some investors will do drawdown funds. I think many more will do these semi-liquid products. And as long as we produce outperformance and have structures that work for them, I think the opportunity remains very significant. And so, our long-term confidence in the private wealth channel is significant. The fact that we have nearly a quarter of our firm's assets there – much, much larger than anyone else. An enormous amount of relationships with financial advisors around the globe and underlying customers, 300 plus people on the ground. We just elevated a new head of our Asia region. We think there's a lot of opportunity here. Markets go up and down, but the long-term opportunity for individuals coming to alternatives remains quite significant.Brian Bedell: And so the growth in that effort, you think, can cut into any kind of reticence on the retail side in the near to intermediate term and continue to propel that channel forward in the intermediate term?Jon Gray: It's always hard to say what the market's going to do. When there's more volatility, people become a little more cautious. But we're not living or building our business week-to-week or month-to- month. We're building it for decades. It is an enduring institution where we're building a brand, where we're so incredibly focused on performance. I know everybody looks at the quarter and says, oh, realization's down. You missed earnings by this amount, or the flows were this. What we're focused on is we deliver performance because when we sit with the customers, that's what they look at. They may be more hesitant in a more volatile market, but their desire to allocate capital to Blackstone actually goes up when we outperform. And when they get confidence again, they come back to us if they're institutions, insurance companies or individual investors. So that's what gives us a lot of confidence about the future. Projecting what's going to happen in the next month or two, that's of course very challenging.Brian Bedell: That’s great perspective. Thank you.Moderator: We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak: Hi. Good morning.Jon Gray: Morning Michal Chae: MorningSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start off with a question on the fundraising outlook for BCRED. I mean, as you noted, Jon, the flow trends have remained robust, but the non-traded BDC market has grown increasingly crowded. It's going to get even more saturated given a growing number of funds in registration. So, while you have a head start on a lot of your peers in this space, I was hoping to hear your thoughts on the growth outlook for BCRED, as well as any potential sources of pressure, such as fees, as the markets become increasingly saturated here.Jon Gray: So, I'd say a couple of things. I think it's hard to overstate the power of the Blackstone brand, what that means to financial advisors and individual customers. You know, this is not a decision when11somebody thinks about putting $50,000 in a non-traded BDC That's a significant decision. And the Blackstone brand means a lot. Also, the performance we've delivered here, I think approaching now 10% since inception in this product. The current yields, 10 plus north. Actually, the vehicle's earning 200 basis points higher than that. The default rate, because I believe we've done a great job focusing on larger companies in the right sectors, default rate remains extremely low. For us, delivering for customers, the strength of the brand, the performance, the relationship with financial advisors matters. And I would point out, unlike the institutional business where there can be thousands of players, if you think about our large distribution partners, I think they're unlikely to put very significant numbers of players on their platforms in these different areas. So if you think about in credit or in real estate or in private equity, I think there'll be a handful of players. I think we'll have a slot in each of those, and we have these really deep long-term relationships and we're delivering for the customer. So yes, the market is getting more competitive. There are other entrants, but we think we have some things here that are very differentiated, and I think we've done a particularly good job in BCRED where we've deployed the capital. I think we're going to do quite well even as the environment gets more difficult because we focused on big companies at much lower loan-to-values on average, 43% at origination. We think that'll make a real difference and when we outperform and you do that against our brand, that tends to be a powerful combination.Steven Chubak: Very helpful color, Jon. Thanks for taking my question.Moderator: We'll go next to Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.Patrick Davitt: Hey, good morning everyone. I have another question on wealth. There's always been a lot of reporting on your efforts to more successfully penetrate the European wealth channel and within that theme chatter of a lot of new products coming to market. So could you update us on what is currently in the market, how traction is evolving on those, and then what the pipeline looks like for things coming online in the coming quarters? Thank you.Jon Gray: So I would say on Europe, it is definitely a harder market to penetrate. Certainly, the US is the largest market and the most open to alternatives. Asia would be next – Hong Kong, Singapore, increasingly Japan. Europe has several challenges. One is just regulatory. Virtually every country has slightly different rules, and many of the rules make it a little more challenging there. The second thing is investors there have not had a lot of exposure to alternatives. There tends to be, particularly on the continent, more aversion to anything that's perceived as riskier, even though we would point out the returns we've generated, the risks we've taken have been very favorable over time. So it's a little bit of a, it's certainly a tougher terrain. We have a couple of small products today in credit and real estate. But right now, it's not a meaningful piece of what we do. We are a persistent group. We do want to try to build scale products in Europe. We've got a number of people on the ground, but it's going to be a little bit tougher sledding. But I think over time, there should be opportunity because the same outperformance relative to liquid markets, this basic idea of trading liquidity for higher returns makes sense. I think it should happen in Europe, but it's certainly slower today.Moderator: Thank you. We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.Brennan Hawken: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, you clearly built a leading capability in real estate and it’s incredibly impressive. Curious to hear your view about maybe what narrows the bid- ask spread in that market. And we heard from Goldman actually earlier this week that they've got a portfolio of $15 billion CRE, and they're looking to sell a significant chunk of that, and they've marked it down 15% across the board to do that. The office position is down 50%, right, but I know you're underexposed to office. So sort of the 15% probably more relevant. And we're hearing other banks are coming to market too. So, while they're not all for sellers, they have different motivations than profit12maximizing. So, what do you think the implications of these transactions are going to be on the market? And is it going to lead to downward pressure on marks?Jon Gray: Well, I think transaction volume has been slow for the reason we've talked about. Obviously, the moving cost of capital has certainly slowed things down. I don't know, given the size of the real estate market, that if any individual transactions are enough to move the market. In fact, I don't know the specifics of Goldman, but I think that's a bunch of different companies and portfolios. So, it's not one large trade. I think the market will ultimately clear based on where buyers and sellers are willing to transact. And you'll see that now, I'm sure, over the coming months, as things start to settle in and if we stay here at this higher rate environment. I think it's very hard to predict exactly what happens. But ultimately, there will be real estate to buy and real estate to sell, and with our $66 billion of dry powder, I think we're going to be in a really unique position. I mean, we raised this $30 billion plus global fund. I think we've invested less than 5% of that fund today. We have the vast majority of our Asia fund uninvested, and our Europe fund we're just raising, so by definition is uninvested. So, we think we're well-positioned in this environment, particularly if banks pull back and there are liquidity shortfalls. We're also raising capital for our real estate debt business, so we think it'll be a favorable environment, and like everybody, we'll be watching what happens on the transaction side.Brennan Hawken: Thanks for that color.Moderator: We'll go next to Ben Budish with Barclays.Ben Budish: Hi there. Thanks for fitting me in at the end. I wanted to ask about BREIT. I know you don't often comment on the performance of, very specific funds, but just since it's also public and investors are following this quite closely. It looked like there was some kind of nice momentum and performance coming into September. And maybe if you kind of parse out what sort of changed in the month, was it cap rate assumption revisions? Was it a slowdown in operating performance? And is there any color you can share perhaps on the performance of the hedge? And how that either impacted September or how you would expect it to sort of benefit the fund over the next couple of months based on the current outlook? Thank you.Jon Gray: So, what I would say on BREIT is, is you really hit on it. In September, the tailwinds in the business were twofold. As you've heard from us, I think we did a very good job hedging out the balance sheet for long duration. That's proven to be very beneficial to the shareholders of BREIT. The second thing is we have a quite sizable position, I think it's now 8% of the portfolio, in data centers. Again, that turned out to be a really, really great decision for our shareholders, and has benefited us. And there was very significant appreciation, which we talked about in the remarks. On the headwinds side, yes, we, of course, raised cap rate assumptions in the portfolio in light of the higher movement in the 10-year treasury yield. And so those were the forces that you saw reflected in the valuations in the month and the quarter.Ben Budish: Great. Thank you very much.Moderator: We'll go next to Mike Brown with KBW.Mike Brown: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch base on the insurance channel here. You said that you had $5 billion of inflows in the quarter. Can you just touch on what were the key contributions there and then maybe expectations for next quarter? And then if you could just touch on Resolution Life specifically. Was that part of the $5 billion inflows this quarter? And how can that partnership progress here over the coming quarters. Thank you.13Jon Gray: So, for clarity, I think we had $5 billion from the big four accounts in insurance, $7 billion overall because we have some SMAs with other major insurers, but not for nearly as large pieces of their portfolio. I'm not sure I'm going to go into any of the individual clients, where the money's coming from and so forth. But obviously, some of the clients are issuing fixed annuities, which is a fast-growing area. That would be namely there, I guess I'd point out, Corebridge and Fidelity Guarantee. And we're helping them with that by deploying capital on their behalf and generating attractive yields. I think Resolution as a platform has a lot of opportunity around legacy books, closed books, buying those from insurers who are trying to reallocate their portfolios. And as part of the recapitalization we did with them, we put a significant amount of capital from our LP community into the company that gives them some firepower to grow.And then I would just add we're having other discussions. Investors are seeing what we're doing, taking up credit quality. I think if you look at the numbers in the quarter, on average our clients had BBB portfolios. This year we've originated on average single A credit quality fixed income, and the spreads have been 140 basis points higher over comparable liquid BBBs. So higher credit quality and still higher spreads. And so, this is something that our existing clients are happy about, our SMA clients are happy about, and it's leading to more discussions. I still think we're in early days. It's hard to predict the timing of these, but this is becoming something that I think is increasingly important for major insurers to have more of these private credit origination capabilities, and they're excited about being partners with us, particularly because we're not an insurance company. We're not directly competing with them.Mike Brown: Okay. Great. Thank you, Jon.Moderator: Thank you. We'll take our final question from Arnaud Giblat with BNP.Arnaud Giblat: Good morning. I just had a follow-up question on BXPE. I'm wondering how much capacity you're warehousing there. Is there an opportunity, I think, to scale up this product rapidly if demand is there? How do you manage that? Is that perhaps by having a large proportion that you can allocate to secondaries to absorb any rapid uptakes? Thank you.Michael Chae: Arnaud, it’s Michael. On the first part about warehousing, we have, as we often do, when we help support the launch of a product like this, we have a relatively modest amount in the grand scheme of our balance sheet in warehouse for the support of the launch of this in the coming months. We expect that will grow somewhat as we approach that point. And then once we're up and running, the needs from a warehousing standpoint will be much more modest. Jon, if you want to comment on asset allocation.Jon Gray: Well, I think we will have a mix of things. Secondaries will certainly be part of the mix. I think we'll do a bunch of opportunistic things in this environment. I think we'll do large scale private equity, some middle market private equity, as I said, life sciences, growth. One of the unique things about Blackstone is the scale of our private equity platform. It's not just one area, and when you think about the individual investor channel and money coming in on a monthly basis, having a very broad platform is important. So, we're going to take advantage of our platform as we deploy capital. And the key thing as we design this product is to deliver strong returns to the customers, because that's how we build something of scale over time. So, if we do a very good job deploying into this dislocated environment, build a track record, then we do believe the scale opportunity is significant.Arnaud Giblat: Great. Thank you very much.Moderator: With no additional questions in queue at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Weston Tucker for any additional or closing remarks.14Weston Tucker: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today and look forward to following up after the call if you have any questions. Thanks very much.[End of Audio]15"

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.2014 Employee Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers.

Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to Director Plan awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9, 2021.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods.

The total shares withheld were approximately 41 million, 53 million and 56 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price.

Management	believes	ROI	is	a	meaningful	measure	to	share	with	investors	because	it	helps	 investors	assess	how	effectively	Walmart	is	deploying	its	assets.		Trends	in	ROI	can	fluctuate	over	time	as	management	balances	long-term	strategic	initiatives	 with	possible	short-term	impacts.		We	consider	ROA	to	be	the	financial	measure	computed	in	accordance	with	GAAP	that	is	the	most	directly	comparable	 financial	measure	to	our	calculation	of	ROI.ROA	was	3.3	percent	and	8.2	percent	for	the	trailing	12	months	ended	October	31,	2021	and	2020,	respectively.	The	decrease	in	ROA	was	primarily	due	to	net	 fair	value	changes	in	our	equity	instruments	as	well	as	the	losses	on	divestiture	of	our	operations	in	the	U.K.	and	Japan,	partially	offset	by	the	increase	in	 operating	income.		ROI	was		14.5	percent	and	13.7	percent	for	the	trailing	twelve	months	ended	October	31,	2021	and	2020.		The	increase	in	ROI	was	primarily	 due	to	the	increase	in	operating	income.We	define	ROI	as	adjusted	operating	income	(operating	income	plus	interest	income,	depreciation	and	amortization,	and	rent	expense)	for	the	trailing	twelve	 months	divided	by	average	invested	capital	during	that	period.		We	consider	average	invested	capital	to	be	the	average	of	our	beginning	and	ending	total	assets,	 plus	average	accumulated	depreciation	and	average	amortization,	less	average	accounts	payable	and	average	accrued	liabilities	for	that	period.Our	calculation	of	ROI	is	considered	a	non-GAAP	financial	measure	because	we	calculate	ROI	using	financial	measures	that	exclude	and	include	amounts	that	are	 included	and	excluded	in	the	most	directly	comparable	GAAP	financial	measure.		For	example,	we	exclude	the	impact	of	depreciation	and	amortization	from	our	 reported	operating	income	in	calculating	the	numerator	of	our	calculation	of	ROI.	As	mentioned	above,	we	consider	ROA	to	be	the	financial	measure	computed	 in	accordance	with	generally	accepted	accounting	principles	most	directly	comparable	to	our	calculation	of	ROI.		ROI	differs	from	ROA	(which	is	consolidated	net	 income	for	the	period	divided	by	average	total	assets	for	the	period)	because	ROI:	adjusts	operating	income	to	exclude	certain	expense	items	and	adds	interest	 income;	adjusts	total	assets	for	the	impact	of	accumulated	depreciation	and	amortization,	accounts	payable	and	accrued	liabilities	to	arrive	at	total	invested	 capital.		Because	of	the	adjustments	mentioned	above,	we	believe	ROI	more	accurately	measures	how	we	are	deploying	our	key	assets	and	is	more	meaningful	to	 investors	than	ROA.		Although	ROI	is	a	standard	financial	measure,	numerous	methods	exist	for	calculating	a	company's	ROI.		As	a	result,	the	method	used	by	 management	to	calculate	our	ROI	may	differ	from	the	methods	used	by	other	companies	to	calculate	their	ROI.16Non-GAAP	measures	-	ROI	(cont.)The	calculation	of	ROA	and	ROI,	along	with	a	reconciliation	of	ROI	to	the	calculation	of	ROA,	is	as	follows:CALCULATION	OF	RETURN	ON	ASSETSCALCULATION	OF	RETURN	ON	INVESTMENTTrailing	Twelve	MonthsTrailing	Twelve	MonthsEnded October	31,Ended October	31,(Dollars	in	millions) Numerator Consolidated	net	income Denominator Average	total	assets1 Return	on	assets	(ROA)2021$8,299$	 247,8573.3	%2020$20,008$	 245,3478.2	%(Dollars	in	millions) NumeratorOperating	income +	Interest	income +	Depreciation	and	amortization +	Rent ROI	operating	income$$202125,542	 141	 10,771	 2,360	 38,814$$202022,383	 132	 11,161	 2,646	 36,322Certain	Balance	Sheet	DataTotal	assets Accumulated	depreciation	and	amortization Accounts	payableAccrued	liabilities$2021October	31, 2020244,851	 $	 250,863	 99,576	 100,168	 54,152	 57,15624,47424,9952019$	 239,830	 91,697	 49,75020,973DenominatorAverage	total	assets1 '+	Average	accumulated	depreciation	and	 amortization1 '-	Average	accounts	payable1 '-	Average	accrued	liabilities1 Average	invested	capital$	 247,85799,872	 55,654	 24,735$	 267,340$	 245,34795,637	 51,951	 22,984$	 266,049Return	on	investment	(ROI)14.5	%13.7	%1	The	average	is	based	on	the	addition	of	the	account	balance	at	the	end	of	the	current	period	to	the	account	balance	at	the	end	of	the	prior	period	and	dividing	by	2.3 Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases, a factor of eight times rent is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating leaseassets are now recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.1 The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period anddividing by 2.2 The average is based on the addition of 'total assets without leased assets, net' at the end of the current period to 'total assets without leased assets, net' atthe end of the prior period and dividing by 2, plus 'leased assets, net' at the end of the current period.3 The average is based on the addition of 'accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets' at the end of the current period to 'accumulateddepreciation and amortization, without leased assets' at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2, plus 'accumulated amortization on leased assets' at theend of the current period.NP = not provided17Non-GAAP	measures	-	free	cash	flowWe	define	free	cash	flow	as	net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities	in	a	period	minus	payments	for	property	and	equipment	made	in	that	period.	We	had	net	cash	provided	by	operating	 activities	of	$16.3	billion	for	the	nine	months	ended	October	31,	2021,	which	decreased	when	compared	to	$22.9	billion	for	the	nine	months	ended	October	31,	2020	primarily	due	to	an	 increase	in	inventory	purchases	to	support	strong	sales	and	lapping	the	impact	of	accelerated	inventory	sell-through	in	fiscal	2021,	as	well	as	timing	and	payment	of	wages.	We	generated	free	 cash	flow	of	$7.7	billion	for	the	nine	months	ended	October	31,	2021,	which	decreased	when	compared	to	$16.4	billion	for	the	nine	months	ended	October	31,	2020	due	to	the	same	reasons	 as	the	decrease	in	net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities,	as	well	as	$2.2	billion	in	increased	capital	expenditures.Free	cash	flow	is	considered	a	non-GAAP	financial	measure.		Management	believes,	however,	that	free	cash	flow,	which	measures	our	ability	to	generate	additional	cash	from	our	business	 operations,	is	an	important	financial	measure	for	use	in	evaluating	the	company’s	financial	performance.		Free	cash	flow	should	be	considered	in	addition	to,	rather	than	as	a	substitute	for,	 consolidated	net	income	as	a	measure	of	our	performance	and	net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities	as	a	measure	of	our	liquidity.		Additionally,	Walmart’s	definition	of	free	cash	flow	is	 limited,	in	that	it	does	not	represent	residual	cash	flows	available	for	discretionary	expenditures,	due	to	the	fact	that	the	measure	does	not	deduct	the	payments	required	for	debt	service	and	 other	contractual	obligations	or	payments	made	for	business	acquisitions.		Therefore,	we	believe	it	is	important	to	view	free	cash	flow	as	a	measure	that	provides	supplemental	information	 to	our	Consolidated	Statements	of	Cash	Flows.	Although	other	companies	report	their	free	cash	flow,	numerous	methods	may	exist	for	calculating	a	company’s	free	cash	flow.		As	a	result,	the	 method	used	by	Walmart’s	management	to	calculate	our	free	cash	flow	may	differ	from	the	methods	used	by	other	companies	to	calculate	their	free	cash	flow.The	following	table	sets	forth	a	reconciliation	of	free	cash	flow,	a	non-GAAP	financial	measure,	to	net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities,	which	we	believe	to	be	the	GAAP	financial	measure	 most	directly	comparable	to	free	cash	flow,	as	well	as	information	regarding	net	cash	used	in	investing	activities	and	net	cash	used	in	financing	activities.Nine	Months	Ended	October	31,(Dollars	in	millions)20212020Net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities$16,291	 $22,880Payments	for	property	and	equipment	(capital	expenditures)(8,588)(6,438)Free	cash	flow$7,703	 $16,442Net	cash	used	in	investing	activities1 Net	cash	used	in	provided	by	financing	activities$(1,530)	 $(18,113)(6,507)(11,340)1	""Net	cash	used	in	investing	activities""	includes	payments	for	property	and	equipment,	which	is	also	included	in	our	computation	of	free	cashflow.18Non-GAAP	measures	-	constant	currencyIn	discussing	our	operating	results,	the	term	currency	exchange	rates	refers	to	the	currency	exchange	rates	we	use	to	convert	the	operating	results	for	countries	where	the	functional	 currency	is	not	the	U.S.	dollar	into	U.S.	dollars.		We	calculate	the	effect	of	changes	in	currency	exchange	rates	as	the	difference	between	current	period	activity	translated	using	the	 current	period’s	currency	exchange	rates	and	the	comparable	prior	year	period’s	currency	exchange	rates.	Additionally,	no	currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations	are	calculated	for	non- USD	acquisitions	until	owned	for	12	months.		Throughout	our	discussion,	we	refer	to	the	results	of	this	calculation	as	the	impact	of	currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations.		When	we	refer	 to	constant	currency	operating	results,	this	means	operating	results	without	the	impact	of	the	currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations.		The	disclosure	of	constant	currency	amounts	or	 results	permits	investors	to	better	understand	Walmart’s	underlying	performance	without	the	effects	of	currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations.	The	table	below	reflects	the	calculation	of	 constant	currency	for	total	revenues,	net	sales	and	operating	income	for	the	three	and	nine	months	ended	October	31,	2021.Three	Months	Ended	October	31,	2021Nine	Months	Ended	October	31,	2021(Dollars	in	millions) Total	revenues:	 As	reported Currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations Constant	currency	total	revenues$$Percent	 Change1 Walmart	International20212021Percent	 Change1Consolidated24,040	 (1,367)	 22,67319.4	% $	 140,525	 (1,367)	 	-24.0	% $	 139,158 N/A4.3	% $	 N/A 	 	3.3	% $Percent	 Change1 Walmart	International20212021Percent	 Change1Consolidated75,098	 (4,720)	 70,37814.0	% $	 419,883	 (4,720)	 	-19.4	% $	 415,163 N/A3.1	% N/A 	2.0	%Net	sales2,3:	 As	reported Currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations Constant	currency	net	sales$$23,627	 (1,347)	 22,28020.1	% $	 139,207	 (1,347)	 	-24.6	% $	 137,860 N/A4.1	% $	 N/A 	 	3.1	% $73,962	 (4,657)	 69,30514.5	% $	 416,237	 (4,657)	 	-19.9	% $	 411,580 N/A3.0	% N/A 	1.8	%Operating	income:	 As	reported Currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations Constant	currency	operating	income$$871	 (79)	 79219.2	% $	 N/A 	 	-26.5	% $5,792	 (79)	 5,7130.2	% $	 N/A 	 	-1.1	% $2,926	 (280)	 2,6468.5	% $	 N/A 	 	-1.9	% $20,055	 (280)	 19,77517.5	% N/A 	15.9	%1	Change	versus	prior	year	comparable	period.	 2	Walmart	International	eCommerce	net	sales	were	$4.3	billion	and	$12.7	billion	for	the	three	and	nine	months	ended	October	31,	2021,	and	were	positively	impacted	by	$126	million	and	$501	 million	of	currency	exchange	rate	fluctuations,	respectively.

Management	believes	that	Adjusted	 EPS	is	a	meaningful	measure	to	share	with	investors	because	it	best	allows	comparison	of	the	performance	with	that	of	the	comparable	 period.		In	addition,	Adjusted	EPS	affords	investors	a	view	of	what	management	considers	Walmart’s	core	earnings	performance	and	the	 ability	to	make	a	more	informed	assessment	of	such	core	earnings	performance	with	that	of	the	prior	year.We	adjust	for	the	unrealized	and	realized	gains	and	losses	on	our	equity	investments	each	quarter	because	although	the	investments	are	 strategic	decisions	for	the	company’s	retail	operations,	management’s	measurement	of	each	strategy	is	primarily	focused	on	the	 operational	results	rather	than	the	fair	value	of	such	investments.		Additionally,	management	does	not	forecast	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	 its	equity	investments.		Accordingly,	management	adjusts	EPS	each	quarter	for	the	realized	and	unrealized	gains	and	losses	related	to	 those	equity	investments.We	have	calculated	Adjusted	EPS	for	the	three	and	nine	months	ended	October	31,	2021	by	adjusting	EPS	for	the	following:1. unrealized	and	realized	gains	and	losses	on	the	company’s	equity	investments,2.loss	on	extinguishment	of	debt;	and3.the	incremental	loss	on	sale	of	our	operations	in	the	U.K	and	Japan	recorded	during	the	first	quarter	of	fiscal	2022.20Non-GAAP	measures	-	adjusted	EPS	(cont.)Three	Months	Ended	October	31,	2021Percent	 Change1 Nine	Months	Ended	October	31,	20214Diluted	earnings	per	share:Reported	EPS$1.1138.3%$3.59Adjustments:Pre-Tax	 ImpactTax	 Impact2,3Net	ImpactPre-Tax	 ImpactTax	 Impact2,3Net	ImpactUnrealized	and	realized	(gains)	and	losses	on	equity	investments$(0.42)	 $0.09	 $(0.33)$0.65	 $(0.13)	 $0.52Loss	on	extinguishment	of	debt0.86(0.19)0.670.86(0.19)0.67Incremental	loss	on	sale	of	our	operations	in	the	U.K.	and	Japan———0.15—0.15Net	adjustments$0.34$1.34Adjusted	EPS$1.458.2%$4.931	Change	versus	prior	year	comparable	period. 2	Calculated	based	on	nature	of	item,	including	any	realizable	deductions,	and	statutory	rate	in	effect	for	relevant	jurisdictions.

6,documents/NDAQ Investor Presentation October.pdf,finance,,"Investor PresentationOctober 2023DisclaimersNon-GAAP InformationIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating expenses, and non-GAAP EBITDA, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at ir.nasdaq.com/Income-Statement-Trend-Summary-and-GAAP-to-Non-GAAP-Reconciliation. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as certain items do not reflect ongoing operating performance.These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this presentation. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this presentation isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.Divisional alignment program: In October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the divisional alignment program will be recorded as “restructuring” in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.

This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For certain Adenza specific term-based subscription license agreements, ARR is calculated based upon annualized contract value, which deviates from U.S. GAAP revenue recognition whereby a portion of the total contract value is recognized upfront as license revenue, with the remainder allocated to the maintenance and support performance obligation and recognized ratably over the contract term. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.AUM: Assets Under Management.Corporate Solutions: Our corporate solutions business serves both public and private companies and organizations through our Investor Relations Intelligence offerings, Governance Solutions & ESG Solutions.ETP: Exchange Traded Product.Gross Retention: As used herein for Adenza, ARR in the current period over ARR in the prior year period for existing customers excluding price increases and upsells and excluding new customers.Net Retention: As used herein for Adenza, ARR in the current period over ARR in the prior year period for existing customers including price increases and upsells and excluding new customers.Net Revenues: Revenues less transaction-based expenses.NFI: Nasdaq's former U.S. Fixed Income business, which was sold in June 2021.NPM: Nasdaq Private Market.Signed ARR: includes ARR recognized as revenue in the current period as well as ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced.Solutions Businesses: Revenues from our Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime segments and Marketplace Technology business within Market Platforms segment.49For Additional Investor Relations InformationInvestor Relations Website: http://ir.nasdaq.comInvestor Relations Contact:Ato Garrett Senior Vice President, Investor Relations ato.garrett@nasdaq.com50"

Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding.Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses, Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. We have updated certain historical information as a result of these changes,including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky's results across the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences segments,and Corporate & Other. Refer to our Form 8-K dated March 13, 2023 for additional information.We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense,and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains,losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Refer to our Form 8-K (Quarterly EarningsRelease) for a reconciliation and further details.We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow theimpact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separatelyin our Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. Adjusted EBITDA conversion is calculated as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow payout iscalculated as total return of capital, consisting of dividends and share repurchases, divided by Free Cash Flow. Refer to our Form 8-K (Quarterly Earnings Release) for a reconciliation and further details.We define Connectivity & Platforms Net Cash Flow as Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. Refer to our trending schedule for a reconciliation and furtherdetails.Constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during therespective periods. Refer to our Form 8-K dated March 13, 2023, for a reconciliation and further details.Consolidated net leverage is calculated as consolidated net debt/trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted to exclude Universal Beijing Resort. Consolidated net debt of $86.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 represents long-term debt, including currentportion (as stated in our Consolidated Balance Sheet), less cash and cash equivalents (as stated in our Consolidated Balance Sheet) and adjusted to exclude $3.5 billion of debt and $0.1 billion of cash at Universal Beijing Resort. Amounts owed under acollateralized obligation are presented separately in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are therefore excluded from consolidated net debt. The denominator of $36.6 billion represents Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 of $36.5billion, adjusted to exclude $0.2 billion of Universal Beijing Resort Adjusted EBITDA losses.Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certaincustomers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Previouslyreported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets.31"

If a taxpayer seeks to report a necessary adjustment that has not been specifically addressed the taxpayer shall enter the item on either Line 2(d) or 2(f) and complete the attached Schedule IV.Pursuant to RSA 77-A:1, XX, New Hampshire has adopted the IRC as of a particular date for each taxable period. As a result, taxpayers must identify any changes to the IRC occurring subsequent to the version adopted by New Hampshire, and account for those changes on their return.

If a taxpayer seeks to report a necessary adjustment that has not been specifically addressed, the taxpayer shall enter the item on either line 2(c) or 2(e).The statutory requirement to follow the IRC applicable pursuant to RSA 77-A:1, XX and RSA 77-A:3-b has significant impact on the tax basis of assets used in businesses operating within and without New Hampshire. A separate accounting of the New Hampshire tax basis must be maintained for depreciation purposes and for determination of the gain or loss in the event of the sale of business assets.LINE 2(a) Add the amount of IRC §179 expense taken on the federal return in excess of the amount permitted pursuant to RSA 77-A:3-b. For property placed in service on or after January 1, 2017, the maximum IRC § 179 deduction is $100,000. For property placed in service on or after January 1, 2018, the maximum IRC § 179 deduction is $500,000.LINE 2(b) Add the amount of bonus depreciation taken on the federal return for assets placed in service this period. Bonus depreciation, allowed federally under IRC §168(k), is not allowed for New Hampshire BPT purposes pursuant to RSA 77-A:1, XX and RSA 77-A:3-b.LINE 2(c) Add any other deductions or exclusions taken on the federal rturn that need to be eliminated or adjusted due to revisions to the IRC occurring subsequent to the applicable version in the table above. Include foreign dividends, when actually distributed, that consist of amounts previously taxed federally as GILTI under IRC § 951A, or of amounts previously taxed federally as deemed one-time repatriation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, but not previously subject to Business Profits Tax. Complete and attach Form Schedule IV.LINE 2(d) Deduct the regular depreciation related to IRC §179 and bonus depreciation not allowed for this tax year or for prior tax years. Because there may be a basis difference due to the federal and state treatment of IRC §179 expense, and bonus depreciation, the regular depreciation allowed under IRC §167 and IRC §168 may be different than that deducted on the federal return. Recalculate your allowable depreciation and deduct the difference on this line.LINE 2(e) Deduct any other items included on the federal return that are required to be eliminated or adjusted due to revisions to the IRC occurring subsequent to the version adopted by New Hampshire pursuant to RSA 77-A:1, XX and RSA 77-A:3-b. Also include the deduction allowed for global intangible low-taxed income under RSA 77-A:4, XIX. Complete and attach Form Schedule IV.LINE 2(f) Increase or decrease the net gain or loss on the sale of assets used in the business which have a different state adjusted basis from the tax adjusted basis reported on the federal return. Because there may be a basis difference to the federal and state treatment of IRC §179 expense, and bonus depreciation, the regular depreciation allowed pursuant to IRC §167 and IRC §168 may be different then that deducted on the federal return. This may create a different adjusted basis to assets used in the business which have not been completely depreciated and thus a different gain or loss for state reporting than that reported on the federal return on the sale of business assets. Recalculate the gain or loss and enter the difference on this line. Adjustments required to account for the net gain or loss attributable to an increase or step-up in the basis of assets pursuant to RSA 77-A:4, XIV shall be reported in Section 6(h).LINE 2(g) The sum of Lines 2(a) through 2(c), minus Lines 2(d) and 2(e), adjusted by Line 2(f); if negative result, use a minus sign.LINE 3 Subtotal Line 1 adjusted by Line 2(g); if negative result, use a minus sign.LINE 4 Separate entity adjustments to income or expense, attach schedule. Enter the amounts which arise from the necessity of adjusting Gross Business Profits to accommodate the New Hampshire requirement of separate entity treatment for business organizations. Do not eliminate investment income on this line, as New Hampshire requires that all business income be included. New Hampshire does not have a non-business income statute.LINE 5 Gross Business Profits, combine Line 3 and Line 4.LINE 6(a) Deduct interest income earned resulting from investments in direct United States obligations, net of expenses, on this line.Federal obligations are exempt from tax by states or their political subdivisions when obligations are issued to secure credit to carry on the necessary functions of government. Exempt U.S. Government interest claimed as a deduction must be reduced by the following expenses if the expenses were claimed as deductions in arriving at your federal taxable income: • interest on money borrowed to purchase or carry the bonds or securities; and • ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in connection with producing exempt income. These expenses may also be added back on Line 6(e). Do not add back twice.LINE 6(b) Add net income taxes, franchise taxes measured by net income, or capital stock tax taken as a deduction on the federal return for any state or political subdivision or foreign taxes based on or measured by net income.The Business Enterprise Tax (BET) is not based on or measured by net income and is not added back. Business Profits Tax (BPT) is based on net income and must be added back, if a deduction for BPT has been taken on your Federal tax return.LINE 6(c) Add federal non-recognized IRC §337 gain. New Hampshire recognizes the gain on the distribution of property from a subsidiary to its parent in complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The gain of the liquidating corporation is determined using the New Hampshire basis of the assets distributed.NH-1120 Instructions 2022 Rev 1.2 11/2022Page 2 of 4New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration2022 NH-1120CORPORATE BUSINESS PROFITS TAX RETURNINSTRUCTIONS - continuedLINE 6(d) Deduct the wage adjustment required by IRC §280C. Deduct the wages or salaries paid or incurred for the taxable year which is equal to the sum of the credit determined for the taxable year under IRC §45A(a), §51(a), §1396(a), §1400P(b), and §1400R.LINE 6(e) Add expenses related to constitutionally exempt income. Expenses that are incurred to produce income that is constitutionally exempt from taxation in New Hampshire must be added back to gross business profits. These expenses include such items as interest expense and other expenses incurred to earn interest from investments in direct U.S. obligations (refer to Rev 303.04 for further information). This add back also includes expenses related to the production of non-unitary income not included on this return.LINE 6(f) Deduct Foreign dividend gross-up (IRC §78). IRC §78 provides that dividends received from foreign affiliates are “grossed-up” to include income taxes paid on the dividends to foreign countries. The taxpayer can then apply the grossed-up amount in computing its foreign tax credit for federal purposes. The amount of gross- up is a separately stated item on the Federal Form 1120, Schedule C. Qualified dividends do not include IRC §78 amounts. Deduct the gross-up on this line.LINE 6(g) A deduction is allowed for the contribution of scientific equipment or apparatus to an educational organization or institute of higher education equal to the sum of the taxpayer's basis in the contributed property plus 50 percent of the unrealized appreciation, or twice the basis of the property, whichever is less.LINE 6(h) The following adjustments are required to account for the increase in the basis of assets federally due to the sale or exchange of an interest in the business organization:Line 6(h) - A: Report the amount of the increase in the basis of assets federally, attributable to the sale or exchange of an interest in the business organization.

If multiple sales or exchanges provide an aggregated figure and attach a schedule of transactions.Line 6(h) - C: Add the amount of depreciation claimed on the federal return that is attributable to an increase in the basis of assets that has not been recognized for New Hampshire purposes pursuant to RSA 77-A:4, XIV(a)(1).For sales or exchanges occurring on or after January 1, 2016, an entry on this line is required to account for federally reported depreciation attributable to an increase in the basis of assets attributable to a sale or exchange transaction where an election to recognize the basis increase pursuant to RSA 77-A:4, XIV(b) was not made in the current taxable period, or a prior taxable period, for the economic life of the asset(s) in question.For sales or exchanges occurring before January 1, 2016, an entry on this line is required to account for federally reported depreciation attributable to an increase in the basis of assets attributable to a sale or exchange transaction where an addition to gross business profits was not made in accordance with Rev 303.05, for the economic life of the asset(s) in question.Line 6(h) - D: Adjust the gain or loss with respect to the sale of assets to account for an increase in the basis of assets that was not recognized for New Hampshire purposes pursuant to RSA 77-A:4, XIV(a)(2).For sales or exchanges occurring on or after January 1, 2016, an entry on this line is required to account for federally reported depreciation attributable to an increase in the basis of assets attributable to a sale or exchange transaction where an election to recognize the basis increase pursuant to RSA 77-A:4, XIV(b) was not made in the current taxable period, or a prior taxable period, upon the sale or disposition of the asset(s) in question.For sales or exchanges occurring before January 1, 2016, an entry on this line is required to account for federally reported depreciation attributable to an increase in the basis of assets attributable to a sale or exchange transaction where an addition to gross business profits was not made in accordance with Rev 303.05, upon the sale or disposition of the asset(s) in question.Enter the cumulative total of all items and adjustments reported on lines 6(h) - A through 6(h) - D.LINE 6(i) Add Qualified Investment Company (QIC) holder's proportional share of QIC profits. Add your share of QIC profits on this line. A business organization which holds an interest in a QIC must add to gross business profits their share of the QIC profits for the year, losses are not deducted. If the QIC makes a distribution, do not include the distribution in gross business profits of the interest holder.NH-1120 Instructions 2022 Rev 1.2 11/2022Page 3 of 4New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration2022 NH-1120CORPORATE BUSINESS PROFITS TAX RETURNINSTRUCTIONS - continuedLINE 6(j) Deduct assistance payments under 12 U.S.C. § 1823.

(“TimesSquare Inc.”) and Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.  TimesSquare was formed to manage TimesSquare Inc.’s growth equity investment advisory business which was sold to TimesSquare in a transaction that closed on November 19, 2004.  The members of TimesSquare’s Small/Mid Cap Growth team joined TimesSquare Inc. on September 7, 2000 after working together at Fiduciary Trust Company International (“FTCI”).  While employed at FTCI, the team managed the Fiduciary Special Equity Fund, an ERISA-only commingled vehicle managed in the Small/Mid Cap Growth style. The team is currently led by Grant Babyak (and Tony Rosenthal), who served as co-manager of the Special Equity Fund starting in 1996 through September 6, 2000.  There has been no change in investment strategy from the prior two firms. Effective October 4, 2000, the team began managing its first Small/Mid Cap Growth account at TimesSquare Inc. Five other Small/Mid Cap Growth accounts came to the team from the same client in the fourth quarter of 2000.The performance record we have submitted to the recipient of this presentation as indicated on the cover consists of the following: From 12/31/85 to 9/30/00:  Gross performance of the FTCI Special Equity Fund as published in the PSN database of manager returns.  TimesSquare has not independently verified the accuracy of the performance published in the  PSN database, all returns in which are submitted by the participating investment management firms.					 From 10/4/00 to 10/31/00:  Gross performance of the TimesSquare Inc. Small/Mid Cap Growth representative account. From 10/31/00 to 11/18/04 and from 11/19/04 to present:  Gross performance of all TimesSquare Inc. and TimesSquare, respectively, discretionary Small/Mid cap accounts with market values greater than $5 million that invested  in stocks with market capitalizations generally between $300 million and $5 billion at time of purchase.The performance of the Fiduciary Special Equity Fund reflects a number of factors, including the contributions of Mr. Babyak and other members of the TimesSquare team such as the four dedicated research analysts (present as of 9/7/00) as well as those of other persons who are not part of the TimesSquare team.  Prior to September 7, 2000, the TimesSquare team also managed other accounts investing in Small/Mid cap growth stocks. Performance of those other accounts may have been higher or lower than that of the FTCI Special Equity Fund.  TimesSquare, however, cannot independently verify that the Fund's performance is representative of the performance of those Small/Mid cap accounts managed by the TimesSquare team prior to September 7, 2000.  Variations in performance, investments, strategies, allocation percentages among other things, can be attributed to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cash flows, timing of purchases and sales of portfolio securities, and investment restrictions imposed by account holders.  There can be no assurance that the future performance of an individual account will be the same as the performance of any other account, including those represented in the historical record we present.The performance figures shown are calculated in U.S. dollars on a size-weighted basis and reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings, and the deduction of brokerage commissions and other transaction costs. Performance is provided on a gross basis (before the deduction of management fees) as well as net of the highest management fee of 1.00% charged by TimesSquare to separately managed institutional accounts in this composite. Investment advisory fees generally charged by TimesSquare are described in Part II of its Form ADV. To illustrate performance net of fees, assume $20,000,000 is placed under management for ten years sustaining 10% compound gross total return.  If an advisory fee of 1.00% of average assets under management is charged per year, for each year of the ten-year period, the resulting compound annual return would be reduced to 8.9%.  The ending dollar value of the account would be $41,874,849 compared with the unreduced account value of $47,130,532.The “linked” performance results included in this presentation are exclusively for the use of the recipient of this presentation as indicated on the cover, and are suitable for use exclusively in “one on one” institutional settings.  The performance results of the Fiduciary Special Equity Fund and the TimesSquare Inc. and TimesSquare return series, for the respective time periods as represented in the linked performance results, are presented on the following pages.The opinions and information expressed and provided are for general information only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations but rather, a basis from which strategies can be built, taking into account the specific objectives of each portfolio, in terms of return, time horizon, and risk constraints, as well as diverging investment perspectives and assumptions.

And please note that, today’s event is being recorded.And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leathers, President and CEO of Werner Enterprises.  Please go ahead with your presentation.Derek LeathersThank you and good afternoon, everyone.  We are excited to welcome you to the Werner Enterprises inaugural earnings conference call.  We prepared an earnings presentation to accompany today’s discussion and hope the additional insight into our results will add context to what we believe is an optimistic future here at Werner.On our call today, I’m joined by our CFO, John Steele.  Since this is our first earnings call, I’ll start by providing a brief overview of Werner and our current positioning, followed by summary financial highlights for the quarter and full year.  John will then provide additional insights into our financials.  I’ll finish by reviewing our business and capital allocation strategies and 2019 financial guidance.  John and I will then address your questions.Now, turning to slide four, we included some background information on Werner for those who may be new to our story, and I’ll highlight a few key items.  For 2018, over three quarters of revenue was generated in our primary segment, Truckload Transportation Services, with the remainder coming from Werner Logistics, which we continue to grow.Looking at revenue by vertical, just over half is in the retail category, which reflects the continuing strength of North American consumers, 18% of our revenues were in food and beverage, and 18% were in manufacturing and industrial, with the remaining 12% in logistics and other category.  We have a diversified customer base with less than half of revenue coming from our top 10 customers and 74% spread across our top 50.  We remain committed to supporting our core customers and their growth while mitigating outsized exposure to any single customer, vertical or seasonal revenue stream.Next, let’s move to slide five for a brief overview of our financial performance.  In the fourth quarter, revenues grew 14% to $646 million.  On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 79% to $0.75 per share.  Adjusted operating income increased $73.6 million, and we expanded our total company adjusted operating margin by 350 basis points to 11.4%.For 2018 in total, revenues grew 16% to $2.5 billion.  The $341 million annual increase was the largest annual increase in our 62-year history.  Adjusted EPS increased 86% to $2.38 a share. Adjusted operating income increased 59% to $229 million, increasing our full year total company adjusted operating margin by 250 basis points to 9.3%.  Along with revenue growth, we’ve been able to continue an improving trend in adjusted operating margin, making 2018 the largest ever year-over-year operating income increase.  These factors also contributed to our achievement of the highest ever adjusted EPS.Results for the fourth quarter reflects freight demand that was stronger than normal, but not as robust as what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2017, which as you recall was atypically strong due to the capacity tightening that occurred following the two major hurricanes in August and September of that year.  The fourth quarter 2018 also reflected a more orderly planned peak season, with increased communication and forecasting with our customers, resulting in strong and more consistent volumes.Reflecting our investments in a newer best-in-class fleet, we ended the year with 7,820 total tractors within our Truckload Transportation Services, or TTS segment, an increase of 385 trucks year-over-year and 70 sequentially.  The entire growth was in our dedicated truckload unit, as part of a deliberate plan towards a more resilient structure throughout the economic cycle.  The economy could slow, or other favorable trends could moderate in the future.  But regardless of the environment, we’ve positioned Werner as a best-in-class carrier and believe our services will be in high demand across economic cycles.Our portfolio has been expanded, our service is greatly improved, and our revenue mix reallocated, all with an eye towards providing our customers and our shareholders with more consistent quality results as we look to 2019 and beyond.On that note, I would like to sincerely thank our professional drivers, mechanics, and office associates who contributed to this historic year for all their hard work, dedication, and commitment to safety.  They represent a constant reminder of our internal rallying cry--average is for other people.At this point, I’ll turn the call over to John to discuss the financial results in more detail.  John?John SteeleThank you, Derek and good afternoon, everyone.  It’s great to be here with you today. Beginning on slide seven, we provide some additional financial performance drivers in the quarter versus the prior year period, a few noteworthy items in the TTS segment.  Our revenue per truck per week increased 6.9%, net of fuel and we increased the average number of trucks by 4.7%.  In our logistics segment, revenues grew 22%.Moving to adjusted EPS, the 79% year-over-year increase consisted of TTS growth that contributed $0.24 and logistics growth that contributed $0.05, as well as, the benefit of a lower tax rate, fewer shares outstanding, and our other business units.Turning to slide eight, let’s look at full year 2018 versus 2017.  In TTS, revenue per truck per week increased 8.4%, net of fuel led by double-digit rate improvement, and we increased the average number of trucks by 4.3%.  Logistics segment revenue grew 24%.Adjusted operating income grew 59% and TTS operating margin expanded 290 basis points.  At the same time, we continue to invest in our professional drivers by increasing average driver pay per company mile by over 10%.Looking at adjusted EPS, the increase included TTS growth that contributed $0.78 and logistics growth that added $0.12, plus the benefit of a lower tax rate, fewer shares outstanding, and our other business units.Beginning on slide nine, let’s look specifically at results for our Truckload Transportation Services segment.  In the fourth quarter, TTS revenue grew 13% versus the prior year quarter to $495 million, primarily driven by an increase in revenue per truck per week of 6.9%, led by strength of our one-way truckload revenue per total mile increase of 10.5%.Adjusted operating income rose 53% to $68 million, which was driven by an increase in adjusted operating margin of 360 basis points to 13.7%.  This represents seven consecutive quarters of expanding our TTS operating margin.  Our adjusted operating ratio, net of fuel surcharge, declined by 420 basis points to 84.1%.For the full year, TTS revenues grew 15% to $1.9 billion.  The increase was driven by growth in revenue per truck per week of 8.4%, led by revenue per total mile increases in one-way truckload of 13.2%.Adjusted operating income grew 54% to $213 million, which resulted in 290 basis points of margin expansion to 11.3% for the full year.  Adjusted operating ratio, net of fuel, declined by 350 basis points to 86.8%.Turning to fleet metrics on slide 10, you may have noted in our earnings release that we began disclosing key operating metrics for both dedicated and one-way truckload within the operating statistics by segment section.We believe that providing transparency into each of the components of the TTS segment is a better way to evaluate our performance, given the different length of haul and pricing dynamics of dedicated and one-way.  Going forward, we will continue to report TTS segment truck, trailer, and revenue per truck operating statistics.  Given the additional clarity and transparency for dedicated and one-way truckload that we’re now providing, we will no longer report certain TTS revenue operating statistics.For your reference, we posted an Excel file with the comparable historical operating statistics data for both dedicated and one-way truckload for the last 12 quarters on the investor relations section of our website at werner.com.So now, let’s look at the dedicated and one-way truckload metrics.  For Dedicated, for the year, we grew trucking revenues, net of fuel by 18% to $817 million.  For the quarter, Dedicated trucking revenues, net of fuel increased 18% to $215 million.  Dedicated average tractors grew 12% for the year and quarter. Dedicated revenue per truck per week increased 5% for the year and 6% for the quarter.One-Way Truckload trucking revenues, net of fuel, for the year increased 9% to $771 million.  For the quarter, One-Way Truckload trucking revenues, net of fuel, increased 6% to $204 million.  One-Way Truckload average tractors declined 4% for the year and 3% for the quarter.  One-Way Truckload revenue per truck per week increased 13% for the year and 10% for the quarter, due primarily to improved revenue per total mile.Within our one-way truckload fleet our two service offerings that are Werner strengths.  For over 20 years, we’ve been a leader in serving both the Mexico cross-border and team expedited markets that on a combined basis make up over 50% of our one-way truckload revenues.Our experience and expertise effectively managing the complex, highly-specialized and time-sensitive nature of these businesses provides a revenue stream that is more stable and less commoditized than traditional point-to-point dry van.  Both cross-border and team expedited inherently have a longer length of haul, which you can see in our one-way truckload operating statistics.Moving to Werner Logistics results on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, logistics revenue grew 22% to $137 million, primarily driven by growth in brokerage.  All five of our logistics units, brokerage, freight management, intermodal, international and final mile, experienced revenue growth.Operating income increased 257% to $7.2 million, driven by a strong peak season and improved operational execution, contributing to the expansion of operating margin by 350 basis points to 5.3%.For the full year, logistics revenue grew 24% and surpassed the $500 million mark to $518 million.  Operating income grew 135% to $20.4 million, which led to a 180 basis point increase in operating margin to 3.9% in 2018.I would now like to turn the final portion of our prepared remarks to Derek, who will cover our strategy, capital allocation priorities, and 2019 outlook.  Derek?Derek LeathersThank you, John.  Before getting into our strategy and outlook, beginning on slide 13, I wanted to provide some important background on our execution over the last several years, which I believe has positioned Werner as a best-in-class carrier that will be in high demand regardless of where we are in the cycle.Beginning in June 2015, we shifted the direction of the company by announcing our 5T’s strategy, followed by our Founder, C.L. Werner, resuming his role as CEO.  At that time, my role as President and Chief Operating Officer expanded to include developing the pathway to realizing the 5T’s objectives, and in May 2016, I became CEO.Over the next three years, we made the necessary capital investments and implemented substantial changes to our organization to position Werner for future success.  These efforts included streamlining our organization by reducing the number of VP positions by 15%;  establishing our balanced revenue portfolio initiative to move towards a goal of roughly one-third One-Way Truckload, one-third Dedicated, and one-third Logistics; aggressively raising hiring criteria for drivers, despite a tight labor market; vertically integrating the largest driver school network in the industry; launching our “Average is for Other People” initiative; and increasing customer service to best-in-class levels; aligning the interest of the executive management team with our shareholders by implementing the comprehensive metrics-driven, pay-for-performance program; expanding our nationwide terminal network and reengineering existing terminals for greater efficiency and better driver amenities; and finally, shifting our asset mix to less cyclical, more consistent revenue streams, resulting in Dedicated now representing 58% of our truck fleet.Moving to slide 14, let me review our strategy.  Since the initial roll out of our 5T’s strategy, Werner has regained its rightful place as a top tier provider in the transportation and logistics industry.  We implemented the strategy to further balance our portfolio and position Werner to excel in both tight-capacity markets, as well as periods of slowing economic growth.  We wanted to reinvent ourselves as a best-in-class carrier and put forth a differentiated value proposition that would be in high demand in any market.I believe we are succeeding by creating improvements that are structural and sustainable, and that with our new and more efficient fleet, combined with high-quality professional drivers, we expect to generate more consistent financial results.In addition, our focus on investing in and growing our Logistics segment further diversifies our portfolio, strengthens our customer offering, and better balances our returns in a variety of market conditions.As we begin 2019 in a relatively strong truckload market, but with broader macro uncertainty, we just completed the third year of a significant reinvestment in our core business.  Our investments, combined with our unwavering commitment to continuously raise the bar for on time, every time customer service are allowing Werner to deliver meaningfully better results.A few proof points, our truck and trailer fleet ages are new, with an average of 1.8 years and 4.1 years, respectively.  And we intend to maintain our fleet at or near these age levels going forward.  This compares to an industry average truck age of 5.8 years.  Despite the very competitive labor market, we’ve achieved one of the lowest driver turnover percentages in the last 20 years.  I’ll speak more about why these two points are important in a minute.We significantly upgraded and expanded our terminal network in multiple strategic locations to improve our driver training and equipment maintenance capabilities.  This investment also provided our drivers with the facilities and infrastructure they need and deserve to keep America moving every day.Since 2016, we’ve nearly tripled our IT investments as part of the 5T’s strategy, improving service to our customers and professional drivers, generating operational efficiencies, and introducing new capabilities across our service offerings.  We value the business of IT and prioritize, rank, and measure our technology initiatives to ensure they align to operational priorities and support our business strategies.  These efforts resulted in Werner delivering the best financial results in our history in 2018.In truckload transportation and logistics, you earn and keep the trust of your customers with each and every shipment.  In simple terms, they vote with their freight every day, and we sincerely thank our customers for each and every vote for Werner.On slide 15, I would like to focus on the talent aspect of the 5T’s.  As you know, hiring, training and retaining skilled drivers is very challenging in the truckload industry, particularly given we recently reached a 50-year low domestic unemployment rate.I am extremely proud of the job our management team has done to build one of the best and most experienced work forces in the industry.  One of the ways we attract and keep top drivers is with our modern and efficient tractors and trailers.  Our truck fleet has nearly a 100% auto-manual transmissions and full active braking collision mitigation technology, and we are aggressively implementing forward-facing cameras.We have grown operating margins, while offering top driver pay and nearly 60% of driving jobs within Dedicated, which offers better quality of life characteristics.  70% of our drivers get home at least once a week, and frequently, our drivers get home multiple times a week, if not nightly.  We have the largest owned driver training school network as measured by professional driver graduates.  We have an industry-leading driver recruiting retention program for former military personnel.And in 2018, we were one of 15 organizations in the US and the only transportation company to earn the Freedom Award, the highest recognition awarded by the United States government to employers for their outstanding support of employees serving in the National Guard and Reserve.  We are also proud to have twice the industry average of female drivers on the Werner team.Even with the tight labor market, we achieved our second lowest driver turnover in the fourth quarter in the last 20 years, and for 2018, we had our third lowest driver turnover rate over the same 20-year period.Shifting gears, on slide 16 is a summary of cash flow from operations, net capital expenditures and the resulting free cash flow over the past five years.  As I noted earlier, since 2015, we’ve been in a relatively high investment period, focusing on strategically improving our fleet and strengthening our organization.With the significant investment in our fleet and terminals largely behind us, we are now targeting net CapEx to be more consistently within the range of 11% to 13% of gross revenues over the long-term.  We also expect to generate significant free cash flow this year of $100 million or more.With increased cash generation, our capital allocation priorities on slide 17 are as follows.  Our first priority is to continue to invest in growth and productivity.  We will not deviate from our commitment to our drivers, customers, and associates to maintain a best-in-class fleet, network, and technology platform.  We will continue to invest in our IT, operational and commercial initiatives, as well as logistics technology across our fleet.  But as noted, net CapEx will moderate going forward and be in the $275 million to $300 million.Second, we will continue to return cash to shareholders.  Werner has a long history of paying consistent, regular quarterly dividends across economic cycles, as well as utilizing share repurchases and special dividends to return excess cash to shareholders.  During the quarter, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share and repurchased 800,000 shares for $26 million.  For the full year, we repurchased nearly 2.1 million shares for $72 million.  We will continue to evaluate all viable options to increase shareholder value, including continued buybacks and dividend increases.Finally, we’re committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet.  With only $125 million of debt outstanding and over $1.2 billion of stockholders’ equity, equating to a low debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3 times, our financial position remained strong and flexible to deliver shareholder value.Looking ahead to 2019 outlook on slide 18, we expect to add approximately 3% to 5% growth in our TTS truck fleet and dedicated in the first half with minimal truckload planned for the remainder of the year.Revenue per total mile for full year 2019 is expected to increase in the range of 4% to 8% compared to 2018.  The increase should moderate through the year, due in part to the comps for revenue per total mile, which strengthened at the end of 2018.Gains on sales of equipment this year are expected to be similar to the $19 million in 2018 and more consistent quarter-to-quarter.  Our effective tax rate will be in the range of 25% to 26% for the year.  We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million.  This will allow us to maintain our truck and trailer fleet at or near the current age level of 1.8 and 4.1 years, respectively.So far, in the first five weeks of 2019, freight demand in our one-way truckload unit has been better than normal for this time of year, but not as robust as the unusually strong freight demand during the same period a year ago.  Remember, that the first quarter of 2018 benefited from two significant events occurring at the end of 2017.  US tax reform, which strengthened demand, and the electronic log device mandate for driver service hours, which limited supply.On slide 19, we’ve outlined a couple of growth scenarios.  Over the past several years, we worked very hard to structure our company to succeed in both growing economy or one in which GDP growth moderates.  In our bullish case, we assume domestic GDP growth greater than 2.5%, which would be characterized by tight driver supply and a solid freight market.In this case, we expect our One-Way Truckload revenue per total mile and driver pay increases to increase in the mid to high single-digit percentage range year-over-year.  Our diversified portfolio allows for the One-Way Truckload and Logistics businesses to prosper while Dedicated continues to provide stable, consistent results and services that are in high demand.In the event, the domestic GDP falls below 2.5%, we would likely see some improvement in driver availability and moderation in freight demand.  Truckload revenue per total mile and driver pay increases would likely moderate to the low to mid single-digit percentage range year-over-year.Our diversified portfolio allows for the Logistics and Dedicated businesses to prosper, while our reduced exposure to One-Way Truckload should help mitigate risk in a moderating economy.  In addition, in one-way truckload, our unique strengths in Mexico cross-border and team expedited services enables more resilient performance in a less robust economy, compared to traditional one-way drive van.  In both scenarios, our commitment remains constant.  We will continue to offer best-in-class support to our customers given our new truck fleet, experienced drivers, and continued strong operational performance.In summary, Werner is well-positioned, with nearly 60% of our fleet in Dedicated, a more stable and predictable business, over 20% of our revenue from a rapidly growing Logistics segment, and less exposure to the One-Way Truckload market than many of our larger competitors.I’m confident that we are positioned for success in our ability to effectively navigate whatever economic environment comes our way in the future.  Our fleet is refreshed, our team is rebuilt and our commitment to excellence is unwavering.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A.QUESTION AND ANSWEROperatorThank you.  And we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  To ask a question, you may press ""*"", then ""1"" on your touchtone keypad.  If you are using a speakerphone, please pickup your handset before pressing the keys, to withdraw your question, please press ""*"", then ""2.""  And to allow for as many callers as possible to ask questions, we ask the callers please limit themselves to one question and a single follow-up.  This call will end at 5:00 PM Central Daylight Time, following the company’s closing remarks.And our first questioner today will be Brad Delco with Stephens.  Please go ahead with your question.Brad DelcoHi, guys.  Good afternoon, Derek and John.Derek LeathersHi, Brad.John SteeleHi, Brad.Brad DelcoFirst of all, congrats on the quarter.  Glad you guys are doing this call and appreciate all the color you provided us, and then good guidance as well.  I wanted to ask you about that rate guidance.  I guess, we should assume that your Dedicated rates will be pretty…continue to move up consistently, and so wouldn’t necessarily be a significant drag to that 4% to 8% range.  But how should we think about your inflationary cost pressures?  What buckets should we be paying attention to?  And I guess, that question really is asking about the driver environment, too.Derek LeathersOkay, Brad.  This is Derek, good question.  And so, from my perspective…first on the inflationary side. As we’ve outlined in the bullish and sort of more bearish case scenario, if we get strong GDP growth, there may be wage inflation, but we like our position and where we’re starting the year.  Our driver wages are very competitive today.  Our driver turnover is at near 20-year lows.  And our ability to mitigate and manage through wage pressures, we feel is at least as good as what others will be faced with.  We’ve got a lot of programs in place and partition pay packages across our network that allows us to kind of apply the medicine where the pain is, in the event that we have tightening labor markets in a specific region of the country.To the portion of the question about Dedicated, the reality is, Dedicated is proven, I think, through this cycle.  Their ability to take rate and be paid…commensurate with the services we provide, and it wasn’t a drag through 2018, certainly was a contributor to our record results.  And we feel comfortable that our customers and the relationships we’ve built and the stickiness of the business we’re in and it’s hard to deliver freight characteristics or such that they’re going to pay for the value that we’re delivering.  So, I don’t view Dedicated as a drag and our rate guidance is inclusive of how we think about our rates overall.  Clearly, in Dedicated, you can mitigate some rate concerns through operational collaboration with the customer.  But I can assure you that our growth in Dedicated is not designed to be a drag in our overall returns.John SteeleAnd just to clarify, Brad, this is John.  The guidance is One-Way Truckload revenue per mile increases year-over-year of 4% to 8%.Brad DelcoYes, I appreciate that, John.  And then as a follow-up, if you don’t mind.  I guess, in a 4% to 8% rate environment, I don’t imagine you would expect margins to decline.  I doubt you would give any guidance to that.  But could you envision a scenario where you get 4% to 8% increases in one-way truckload rates and margins would decline on a year-over-year basis?John SteeleBrad, we did not include earnings guidance as part of this call, it’s difficult in trucking with all the variables of the freight market, the rate market, the driver pay market, the safety performance, the used truck market, and other factors to predict how earnings will play out.  So, we wanted to set some guideposts for you with the six different guidance metrics that we provided to give you some help in doing your modeling.  But it’s hard to answer that question, because we don’t really know where some of the cost factors will play out.  I mean, it’s our expectation to continue to improve Werner’s earnings performance going forward, and that’s our goal.Derek LeathersI would just add, our focus this year is clearly going to be on the cost side of the equation.  2018 was a year buoyed by strong rate improvement.  And as we think about 2019, knowing that the rate environment will not be the same as 2018, but we still believe has upside, nevertheless, we have to have a laser focus on controllable cost and operational excellence and that’s what our focus will be on every day.Brad DelcoNo, I appreciate that guys, I had...I felt like I had to try, but I appreciate the color.  And again, thanks for doing the call.Derek LeathersThank you.John SteeleThanks, Brad.OperatorAnd the next questioner today will be Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.Amit MehrotraThanks.  Congrats on the good results and thanks again for the call as well.  John, I am sure you are going to miss those marathon callback sessions.  You talked about wage inflation with respect to driver pay in the bear, and I guess, bear case.  I was hoping you could help us bridge that to the actual comp wages and benefits line on the income statement just given the mix impact on that line from maybe more dedicated mix.  So, any thoughts there on how do you think that line item should trend in 2019 there may be, either on absolute dollar basis or in a total mile basis, anyway you want to think…help us think about that?John SteeleOkay.  I’ll just summarize, salary wages and benefits were up $19.6 million, roughly $12 million, or two-thirds of that...not quite two-thirds was due to driver pay.  The other items that increased were non-driver pay due to fleet growth, merit increases and performance pay and then logistics pay due to the growth in logistics also…had a less significant impact on increasing salary and wages.For Dedicated, being nearly 60% of our fleet, it is a one-customer discussion, when we are working with our customers to obtain driver pay increases for our drivers in a difficult driver market.  So, it’s not as complex a process as One-Way Truckload, where it’s multiple customers that are involved.  So, our customers in Dedicated have supported us with driver pay increases...with rate increases that would allow for driver pay increases in the past and we expect with proper justification they will do that going forward.Derek LeathersThe only thing I would add is that, the other thing that we will have some benefit from in 2019 is, as we grew our logistics business north of 20%, you have to lead often in logistics with labor.  There’s a training curve, learning curve, and development curve that takes place.  Our tech and our tech investments are now catching up to that.  And our ability to have…to gain productivity out of new hires is better as we look forward than it was as we look to the rear.  So, I do believe, that part of the component that John spoke about looks better as I look forward than what we’ve seen in 2018.Amit MehrotraOkay, that’s helpful.  And then just as a follow-up, I guess, on the higher truck count, the 3%-to-5% in Dedicated, I guess, that will obviously continue to pressure overall length of haul, and as a result overall utilization.  You obviously have utilization down 2.8%, almost 3% in 2018.  Is that how we should think about 2019, is that even...can we see even more pressure in 2019, given the growth in the Dedicated truck count?Derek LeathersWell, that’s a good question.  But the reality of part of why we’ve broken out and chosen to, not only be more transparent with some of the operating metrics, but also give you a rear-looking three years comparable on our...on the metrics we’re providing is we think the more appropriate metrics, is not a combined length of haul or a combined productivity, but rather, how is One-Way Truckload operating?  What is happening from production?  What is happening with length of haul?  And obviously what is...how does that translate to revenue for truck per week and revenue per truck per month.On the Dedicated side, fleets come in all shapes and sizes.  So, we can have low productivity, high-yield fleets.  We can have high productivity fleets that are priced appropriately for the miles that are inclusive.  And so, we really believe in Dedicated, it really comes down to kind of revenue per truck per week or in our case, internally revenue per truck per day-type metrics, that define success.  So, we would prefer…I would prefer that people have less focus on what is a combined or blended fleet average, because it’s less meaningful and less of an indicator to ultimate results than the new kind of broken out more transparent metrics that we are providing.John SteeleAnd clearly, Amit, there is significantly different lengths of haul, miles per truck, rate per mile characteristics between Dedicated and One-Way based on the increased transparency we provided with the One-Way Truckload metrics.Amit MehrotraGreat.  Okay, I will hop back in the queue.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I appreciate it.OperatorAnd the next questioner today will be Ben Hartford with Baird.  Please go ahead.Ben HartfordYes.  Hi, thanks.  Good afternoon and thanks for having the call.  Derek, so as we look at TTS margins all-in at 11.4%, you’ve talked about an 11% all-in full cycle margin, so well done getting to this level.  As we think about the business and the mix shift that you talked about the path forward, how should we think about the margin profile in the business from these levels having tripped at 11%?  Is this...is there still more work to be done and the opportunity for margin improvement is still there kind of irrespective of the rate environment? Should we think about that 11% all in as a full cycle leverage?  Could you provide a little bit of perspective on that?  Thanks.Derek LeathersSure.  Thanks for calling in, Ben.  It’s good to talk to you.  First off, we had set short-term goals out of the last couple of years to get to that 11% operating margin.  And we knew, it would be...we had a lot of work to do to get there.  You’re correct, we’ve arrived, and we’ve achieved that margin as we sit here today.  Certainly, our goal is not to rest on our laurels or accept that as status quo.  I think, as we think about margins going forward, the way we think about it is use the word “through the cycle”.  And obviously, sometimes in trucking, cycles can get very tough.  And so, our commitment is that, it’s 11% or better on average through the cycle.  But clearly, our aim is to expand on margins as we go forward and do better than that in periods throughout the cycle.  But there...I can’t predict the future, I can’t predict what the US economy looks like two years out.  And so, I’m not willing to commit to a margin by year.  Looking forward, our expectations are rising, our execution is improving, that I will commit to.John SteeleAnd let me add, Ben, that to clarify, these are margins inclusive of fuel.  So, some of our competitors and we’ve also disclosed the impact of net of fuel margins.  That would be another 200 to potentially 300 basis points higher, if you did it on a net of fuel basis.Ben HartfordYes.  That’s helpful.  Thanks.  I got a quick follow-up, on the Logistics side, obviously, facing some tough comps, but great growth.  Here, specifically, Derek, the line that you included in here about shippers tending to consolidate business with larger asset-backed logistics providers.  I guess, first, can you provide us some sense as to what volume or revenue growth in logistics should look like in 2019 against these comps?  And then, two, when that business does win business in 2018, kind of going forward, who do you think you are winning that business from and could the pace of that perhaps accelerate for any given reason?Derek LeathersOkay.  So, there is a lot there, but a good question.  First off, as we think about Logistics growth, clearly, we’ve indicated that it will have an outsized revenue growth compared to the overall TTS segment.  Our focus is there, the market is ripe, and there is opportunity in front of us.  We are going to continue to pursue those aggressively.  As you think about inside of our logistics business, roughly two-thirds of that business is in our Brokerage unit.  Our Brokerage unit is winning business across the multitude of different avenues.To include this some of it’s coming from small brokers or traditional brokers, we’re able to compete and with our investment in technology, automating more processes, using more machine learning in AI to be able to execute that business more efficiently.  That allows us to compete head-to-head with the biggest of the big out there.  And so, as you...in the latter part, was...is there anything that you should think about as it relates to accelerating that growth or increasing those trends?And the only one I would point to, that I feel excited about, but we’ve got work to do, is we’ve built this business predominantly with smaller-to-midsized shippers and in many cases, new to Werner customers.  Now, that this business has scaled, now that it’s relevant and now that the business execution is at that top tier level, we are now gaining entry into more of our traditional book of business and starting to grow with people that we have longstanding relationships with.  So, the opportunity for that to sort of gain momentum over time or at least to start adding new revenues in larger quantities and then perhaps more lumpy, as you think about the revenue coming in the door is in front of us.  And we’ve seen recent examples of that that have been internalized and executed on very well.Ben HartfordThank you for the time.OperatorAnd the next questioner today will be Tom Wadewitz with UBS.  Please go ahead.Tom WadewitzYes.  Good afternoon, and thank you also for doing the call and for all the good information that you’ve provided.  Wanted to see Derek, if you could offer some thoughts on capacity in the market. I think that we see some data points of private fleet expansion. I think I’d be curious to hear your thoughts from the brokerage side, if you think small fleets are expanding, so maybe just kind of an overall look on capacity?  And then also I think, if you can weave in something on used trucks because you think if at some point, the used truck prices might be slowing or falling off, if the new tractors really replacement tractors.  So sorry that’s a little longwinded, but some thoughts on capacity?Derek LeathersYes, no problem, Tom.  I would be happy too, first on the capacity side.  So, we’ve been consistent throughout 2018 with our messaging that truck orders are not the same as truck builds, and the truck builds are not…that replacement-level truck builds were higher than previously anticipated.  Our reasoning for that is, I will go back to the third quarter data, because we don’t have everybody released yet for the fourth quarter.  From the third quarter, publicly traded group ran 8.8% less miles across their fleets than they did a year prior, despite having relatively flat capacity levels.  And the point is, as we continue to see more congestion, more of an impact of the electronic logs and other factors out there that make…short…like shortening length of hauls, you need more trucks to deliver the same amount of freight.  Now, do I believe some truck capacity came into the market? I do.  The question is, how much was needed to simply do replacement tonnage levels due to the inefficiencies I just described. And I think that eats up a chunk of it.  As we said in January, freight is as strong as we indicated not as strong as 2018, but stronger than the majority of the preceding five years and has remained so.  It’s also been more orderly.  So, I feel capacity is tighter than people think.Our conversations with our customers continue to be positive and we continue to have conversations about securing more capacity not about an abundance of overcapacity.  As you cycle that through the used truck market, that one is really a market within a market.  And we’ve spent a lot of time and effort to refresh our fleet and to put our self in a position for lower-cost of total ownership through selling our fleets at a younger age…our trucks at a younger age through a more retail network.  So frankly, I feel as though…although, there may be some softening in the back-half, and there’s no indication of that currently, by the way, even then when we are selling automated manual transmissions with collision mitigation technology with low miles and warranty still available, we feel good about our positioning via our retail network to outperform the market.Tom WadewitzOkay.  Yes, that’s great.  That’s helpful.  And maybe just a quick…I don’t know if it’s a clarification or more detail.  The 4% to 8% view on pricing, so that’s a full-year number.  How does that translate to kind of what you get in the bid season?  Is that kind of low single-digit, mid single-digits?  How do you think about that part of what you…kind of what you get coming out of the 2019 bid season?Derek LeathersWell, the unfortunate reality of our Q4 call is that it happens early enough in Q1 that we are not really into the throes of bid season just yet.  I can tell you that recent experiences have been very positive, and conversations continue to be at or above those ranges that are…that we’re currently talking about.  We do expect that as you get further into the year, the potential exists and it’s mostly with an eye toward macroeconomic uncertainty than it is to anything structural or secular within our building that I can’t predict exactly what that look like. Hence the broader range.  But, earlier in the year you will have some lapping effects and some comp effects that will be more positive.  We indicated that it would mitigate, or rate increases year-over-year may mitigate as the year…as you get further into it.  But, early signs are positive, early renewals are at or above those ranges provided.  And so to your comment about low single digits, that is not something we’re seeing currently.Tom WadewitzOkay, great.  Thank you for the time.John SteeleThanks, Tom.OperatorAnd the next questioner today will be Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.Todd FowlerGreat, thanks and good afternoon.  Derek, on the march towards getting to a third Dedicated the third One-Way Truckload and a third Logistics.  Can you talk about how the One-Way Truckload fleet fits in that strategy?  Is that to, continue to just kind of shrink that fleet over time or is it to hold it steady while the other businesses grow?  And if you could provide just some maybe some thoughts on 2018…or excuse me on 2019, understanding a lot of the growth that’s getting on the Dedicated side.  What should we expect with One-Way Truckload?Derek LeathersYes.  So first off, what we wanted to do with One-Way Truckload just to…from a history purposes is, we needed to right-size it and we needed to focus on our strengths.  And so, our strengths are cross-border Mexico and expedited just in time type delivery cycles.  They both have longer length of haul profiles, they are harder to do businesses and service expectations are at the very, very top of the portfolio.  We wanted to emphasize that and right size that fleet to be able to serve that specific portion of our business.  We’ve done that, as we look forward and you think about a third, a third, a third--it really comes down to growing the pie overall.  What we want to do is, continue to pursue a revenue growth path that allows the opportunity for both, for us to better serve our customers, grow opportunities for our associates, and provide more high-quality driving jobs for our drivers.  So that is really where our focus will be.  We have some work to do in Logistics to continue to outgrow Logistics, as comparison to the other two-thirds, and we’re doing that.  Our commitments are wavering to continue to accelerate that growth and to…and try to sort of round out the portfolio, if you will.Over time, future asset adds in TTS are going to be determined by returns.  And so, although, we say in the first-half of the year, dedicated is where those trucks will grow, that is because of ongoing either closed or near closed opportunities that we need to build for and prepare, and that’s where those fleets…those trucks will end up.  But, over the cycle, we will compete for trucks.  Our people internally understand this very well.  As opportunities come and CapEx budgets are decided upon, those trucks will be open for acquisition by both parts.  And it will really come down to what’s the return profile?  Does it play to a strength?  And do we believe we can be best-in-class in that space?  If we can, we will pursue it; if we can’t, we’re going to fall back to focusing on what we do better than…what we believe best-in-class.Todd FowlerOkay, that helps.  And then just for a follow-up, you know, I think that we’ve seen points in prior cycles where demand for dedicated increases when we get to points where capacity is really tight and then you shift to Dedicated…the market in general shifts to dedicated and then when things loosen up, some of those Dedicated accounts kind of walk away from the commitments that they’ve made.  What would your view be on the dedicated market now and maybe why that may or may not happen, if we see some loosening in the market going forward?Derek LeathersSo my biggest view is really…first of all, your assessment is correct, but it’s only if you allow it to happen to you.  And it doesn’t start once you have the account, it’s how much you let in the door.  And so, over the last year, although, dedicated is growing, our win rate in Dedicated arguably was at historically low levels because we were that specific about what we wanted to let into the fleet and into our portfolio.  What I…what you are really referring to is designated fleets, which were masquerading as Dedicated, and we work very hard this cycle to not let that happen.  So the fleets that we’ve added in the year, as well as, the fleets that we’ve removed had…fell on one side or the other of that fence.  So what we were pursuing was take-or-pay variable pricing fleets that had fixed and variable rate structures, where we were in it together with our customer to provide best-in-class service.  What we try to avoid is fixed-rate fleets or designated fleets or things that do go away, as capacity starts to exceed demand.  And so, I think our positioning for the cycle is better than it’s ever been.  And that’s why, throughout our opening remarks, we continuously spoke to that fact.  So will there be pressure?  There could be. But pressure starts in spot, goes to one-way, ends up in Dedicated, and if you have designated they will find it.  And so, we like our positioning across our portfolio and how we’ve structured our defensibility for any cycle change that may be forthcoming.Todd FowlerOkay, very helpful.  Thanks for the time and nice quarter tonight.John SteeleThanks, Todd.Todd FowlerThanks, John.OperatorAnd our next questioner today will be Scott Group with Wolfe Research.  Please go ahead.Scott GroupHi, thanks.  Good afternoon, guysJohn SteeleHi, Scott, how are you?Scott GroupGood.  Thanks for the call.  So wanted to just follow-up on that last point, Derek, as we think about the increasingly mix of Dedicated.  Is there any way you can help us think about the variability of Dedicated versus over-the-road margins through a cycle, like sort of the typical peak-to-trough range, I am guessing it’s a lot smaller for dedicated, but is there any way you can put some numbers around that, so we can think of?Derek LeathersSure, Scott, it’s a great question and its part of what we spent so much time on in 2018 to position ourselves in advance of the cycle that we believe is still, call it, too early and perhaps too aggressively.  But, to answer your question, in Dedicated, peak-to-trough is going to be 200 or 300 basis points, and we believe we can live within that range and often even operate tighter than that.  It has to do with characteristics, the defensibility of it, frankly the hard-to-deliver expectations of those customers and the fact that what we…the space that we operate is in more the economic or recession-proof area of the retail sector.  Obviously, in One-Way, traditional variability has been more in the 500 to 600 basis points range.However, with our increased focus and now over 50% of our One-Way assets being sort of set aside or focused on cross-border Mexico and expedited services, those have generally operated better and have less range.  So as we look forward, we think the traditional 500 to 600 basis points range for One-Way probably until proven otherwise, should still apply.  But it’s certainly our expectation that, that will not be the case with our current structure on the One-Way side.Scott GroupOkay, very helpful.  And then one just sort of maybe smaller question.  The over-the-road length of haul is going higher.  What’s driving that and do you think that’s sustainable?Derek LeathersI think it is sustainable and what’s driving it is our…is our focus on cross-border Mexico and team-expedited service.  So again, when you think about our over-the-road length of haul, part of why we want to break our metrics out and be more transparent and show what we do in our one-way network is because of the sort of white noise that can otherwise be created and thinking that all over-the-road truckers are created equal.  We have different niches, different strengths, and we’re playing to ours.  Cross-border Mexico length of haul has been consistently long for, as long as, I’ve been doing business, and I’ve been doing business in Mexico for 30 years.  Team expedited is similar in its nature.  Team expedited is also more defensible against intermodal conversion, because it’s, by its very nature, service sensitive and more importantly, transit sensitive.  So that’s where we want to put our focus and our efforts, that’s what we’ve done and we’re going to continue to build upon it.  So yes, I think it is sustainable.Scott GroupOkay. Thank you, guys.  I appreciate it.OperatorAnd the next questioner today is David Ross with Stifel.  Please go ahead.David RossYes.  Good afternoon, gentlemen.John SteeleHi, Dave.David RossSo I guess, just if you can comment on the year-to-date, the first five, six weeks started off here in 2019 business levels, conversations with customers about their outlook for the year.  How does that compare to where you would have thought it would have been, say, in December?Derek LeathersWell, I would say, from my point of view, I mean we certainly expected that January wasn’t going to look like December.  And so, we came into it with eyes wide open and understanding seasonality and the expectation that it would be different.  I would tell you that in January, you know, if you take the five weeks and you slice it a little more finite, the opening couple of weeks of the year were perhaps a little slower than I might have expected, but then quickly rebounded and have consistently remained stronger than all but 2018.  We think that’s the normal, not the first two weeks. And the first two weeks, I think, were driven by a variety of things, but one of which was to the extent there was some around the margin pull forward and other items that took place relative to people supply chain management, we may have suffered from some of that.  The other thing was, both Christmas and New Years this year hit at very inopportune times just in terms of the cadence and within the week.  And what it created was larger bridges from the actual holiday to the following weekend with more drivers off.  That quickly has bounced back, our network is back in balance.  And as we’ve said, it’s been consistently stronger than every year but last year.  And last year was truly an anomaly in January, especially.David RossAnd then, Derek, you talked about one of the focuses in the last few years to get the margins right and to get the company positioned where you wanted to be was on service.  Could you add a little bit more color around the service improvements that you made?  How you measure them?  How you got them?Derek LeathersAbsolutely, that’s a great question, I am glad you asked.  So yes, the whole part of this process really starts with…you have to have a product that people want to buy, and it has to be in high demand.  In order for that to be real, it has to be high quality.  So we had to make a deep down commitment to improve our service levels and we did so throughout the organization.  We’ve always measured it, we’ve always had metrics, but the focus and the expectation of acceptable wasn’t where it needed to be.  So over the last two years and specifically even in 2018 we’ve increased our service levels across each one of our major operating units and in each case, I believe, they are now at best-in-class levels and we can compete with anybody on service head-to-head.  It makes it easier for our customers to use us, it makes them easier to vote for Werner and it’s something we are very proud of.I mean, as a side note, I was looking at this yesterday.  But over the last 18 months, we’ve won 52 different awards, spread across customer awards, employment awards, and governmental recognition.  That is far greater than what we would have seen in the five preceding years combined.  So people are noticing. We still have work to do.  We’re going to stay committed on this, and we’re going to continue to drive forward.  But I will tell you this and it is a last thought, nothing beats having high-quality drivers that choose to stay in your fleet, gain tenure and get better at what they do.  And so, I just want to plug our drivers one last time that 20-year low turnover that we’ve been talking about for multiple quarters in a row, it’s really coming home to roost in the form of high-quality service, of course, we wrap it with technology and systems and tracking and tracing, but at the end of the day, the professional men and women out there delivering the service are doing so at levels we haven’t seen in a long, long time, and that’s something I’m very proud of.David RossThat’s great. Thank you.OperatorAnd the last questioner for today will be Bascome Majors with SIG.  Please go ahead with your question.Bascome MajorsYes, thanks for squeezing me in here.  I mean, your outlook you put out here today is...it sounds pretty constructive and certainly, constructive in some corners of the marketplace.  And you’ve talked about returning capital and attractive free cash flow and lower CapEx.  I was curious, what tolerance do you have for leverage if the opportunity presents itself to be more aggressive and opportunistic on the buyback?  And maybe a little bit on how you think about the buyback conceptually. Is it quantitative, is it P/E-based, like how do you assess valuing your own shares?  Thank you.Derek LeathersSo let’s start with the first part of the question about tolerance for debt or leverage on the balance sheet.  We are very committed and very proud of the strong balance sheet we have today.  We also like the flexibility in the capacity that we have on that balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic, should the right situation arrive.  We are open-minded to leverage and will remain that way, but it’s got to make sense.  And so, as we think forward and look at the opportunities in front of us, even in…throughout a cycle, our current leverage ratios are low.  There is opportunity obviously for them to expand and still be conserve…highly conservative in nature, and we will utilize our balance sheet as we see fit based on what we think is the best opportunity to create shareholder value.The second part of your question, buybacks.  So you saw that we participated in some buybacks throughout the year.  Buybacks are simply one of the things on the menu as we think about returning cash to shareholders, we think about dividends and buybacks.  Obviously, M&A and special dividends is something that we’ve employed in the past as well.  We will continue to be open to those options.  We’ll continue to look at each of those and evaluate what we think makes sense, given the current market conditions, our current balance sheet strength, and what we think makes the most sense at the time.  Beyond that, I can’t give you a lot more color, because it will be a decision that we will work on and debate internally and give serious consideration to over time.Bascome MajorsThank you, Derek.OperatorAnd this will conclude our question-and-answer session.  I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Derek Leathers, who will provide closing comments. Please go ahead, sir.CONCLUSIONDerek LeathersThank you.  So first off, I want to thank you all for calling in today.  It’s an historic day for us to have our first earnings call and something that we are proud to be doing and proud to be a part of with all of you.  We’ve spent the last three years, if you go to slide 21, strategically investing in and transforming our company to perform across a variety of economic cycles.Our heavy investments are behind us, and the resulting benefits to our free cash flow are ahead.  The high customer service levels that Werner provides are expected to strengthen with our new fleet, increasing experienced team of associates, and the commitment to industry-leading technology.As we look ahead, our long-term margin and return expectations are higher than what they’ve been in the past.  And finally, we are better positioned today than we have been in our recent past.  We’re committed to delivering shareholder value across the cycle.  As I tell our drivers all the time, there has never been a better time to drive blue.In closing, our decision to begin hosting quarterly earnings calls underscores our commitment to increasing our transparency and its concerted effort to enhance our investor relations efforts.  I want to thank everyone for participating in our first earnings call and for your interest in Werner Enterprises.  If you have any follow-up questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.OperatorAnd today’s conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.  And you may now disconnect your lines.Werner Enterprises, Inc.

The first game saw the player taking part in a number of training exercises, with this sequel placing the player in Vietnam.  Cascade, however, disappeared soon after 19 Part 1.221b Baker Street – DatasoftConversion of Commodore 64 game.  Reported in T’zers in issue 4 of Your Sinclair.2112AD - 128K Version – Design DesignPossible 128K version of the game mentioned in issue 47 of Sinclair User.3D Sea – ActivisionThis is mentioned in T’zers in issue 12 of Your Sinclair.    The game was unreleased by Activision but did eventually appear as 3DC by Hit Pak.A& F Software Unnamed Games – A & F SoftwareFirst, an unnamed board game previewed in Issue 2 of Your Spectrum who reported that A & F had “recently signed the rights to a new title, launched recently at Earls Court toy fair.”Second, from issue 6 of Your Spectrum another unnamed game (who knows what the hell this was supposed to be!):”It’s a brilliant idea and we’ve already got a lot of the graphics done.  But I can’t say any more at the moment.”A Question of… - Peter Stevens/Interstella SoftwareA series of Q & A general knowledge games.  Mentioned in issue 6 of Your Spectrum which reports that the first in the series will probably be A Question of Sport.Ace Trucking Co. – PiranhaCrash issue 47 carried a feature on the 200AD games which Piranha were planning.  The article mentions at the end that Piranha are considering a game based on this strip.Addictaball – Alligata SoftwarePreviewed in Your Sinclair.Adventures of Bond…Basildon Bond – Probe SoftwareGame based on Russ Abbott’s television character (well, it probably sounded like a good idea at the time!).  Advertised for both Spectrum and Commodore 64, only the C64 version was ever released.Airwolf – Ocean SoftwareOcean advertised this game in late 1984/early 1985.  Elite in fact obtained the licence to produce the Airwolf game, so Ocean’s version never appeared.Alice – St BridesMentioned in issue 45 of Sinclair User in the feature on St Brides.Anaconda – Software ProjectsPreviewed in Sinclair User, the game is a:“Multi-stage spacey shoot out which plays at about every orientation you could imagine.You can fly a space ship vertically up the screen, shooting and bombing, you can fly a space ship sideways across the screen, and you can go sideways and diagonally and every other way in a plan-view section...”Sounds brilliant!Android 3 – Costa Panayi/Vortex SoftwareInterviewed in issue 32 of Sinclair User, he states, “I was tempted to do Android 3…but I decided to leave it for another day.”Apprentice – Probe Software/Rainbow ArtsPreviewed in issue 79 of Crash.Aquadrome – Ariolasoft/ActivisionThe sequel to Panzadrome.  First reported in T’zers in Your Sinclair number 1.  The game was to first be published by Ariolasoft but a later report appeared stating that Activision were to publish the game.Around the World in 80 Days – Don PriestlyAn unfinished game which Don Priestly mentions in his interview on I’ve Started So I’ll Finish.Assignment Hong Kong – Sterling SoftwareSequel to Assignment East Berlin.  Reported in issue 33 of Sinclair User.Astranoids – Simon Cobb/CCIA finished game which was unreleased.  Simon Cobb refers to this game in the article on Lothlorien in issue 8 of Crash.Atomic Robokid – ActivisionA conversion of the arcade game of the same name,  A demo of the game was featured on the cassette on the front of issue 64 of Your Sinclair.  TZX reports that “the game was scrapped when Activision wound down their Spectrum game development.”Attack of the Mushroom People – GlobalThis was to be the second in Global’s series of games based on the Golden Turkey films.Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars – Matthew Smith/Software ProjectsMatthew Smith had been quiet for three years after the release of Jet Set Willy when Willy Meets the Taxman failed to appear.  This game was heavily advertised during 1987 and was much hyped as his great comeback game.  An interesting preview of the game appeared in the June 87 issue of Sinclair User.“Speedy scrolling roads with some trucks and some birds and a dog (for that’s what the game entails) may not sound like the makings of  wonderful epic but, technically, it’s pretty damned neat.The graphics are enormous and everything zooms around at impressive speed.  It’s looking very good, and, let’s face it, it’s been three years in the making, and so it really ought to be.Gameplay-wise it seems a little freaky, as it seems to involve not a great deal other than running left and right on the screen and trying not to get either run down by a truck or bombed by a chicken.”Apparently Smith was unhappy with the finished product and it was not released.  The game was re-written (not by Matthew Smith) and was eventually released by Software Projects as Star Paws.Automan – Bug-Byte SoftwareGame based on the short-lived American TV series.  Bug-Byte did release the Commodore 64 version of the game, which was fairly awful.  The Spectrum version was previewed in issue 9 of Your Spectrum:“…the game will begin with an underworld consortium having stolen the design of a program to create and control Automan, which they use to produce an evil facsimilie.  That, of course, will never do, so it’s up to the player to find the imposter’s controller and destroy the program – a task which will only be possible after working through the game’s two main modules.The first of these will be a cartoon adventure in which animated characters move around on what John [Phillips] describes as a lifelike display, while carrying a variety of objects and performing an equally varied selection of tasks.  Exactly what these objects are or what dangerous deeds are to be performed, JP isn’t saying.Anyway, on to phase two.  This is where it’ll all happen, because the imposter’s controller will have to be chased through a 3D display of Manhatten skyscrapers to his home base, where there’ll be a cartoon showdown as to try to destroy this techno-criminal’s computer and black out the imposter Automan.”The game was supposed to be completed for Christmas 1984.Baal – SilversoftFrom issue 41 of Sinclair User: “An arcade adventure with similar graphics to Alien 8 (again?).  Baal, an apprentice devil must prove his worth before being allowed to steal souls from earth.  Work your way up the levels to get out of hell.”  It was supposed to be scheduled for an August 1985 release.Backpackers Guide to the Universe Parts 2 & 3 – Bob Hamilton/Fantasy SoftwareBackpackers Guide to the Universe Part 1 was billed as the first part of a trilogy.  Sadly, Fantasy disappeared soon after they released the first game.Bandersnatch – Imagine SoftwarePerhaps the most (in)famous of all the Spectrum unreleased games.Probably the best article on the story behind the game can be found in issue 12 of Crash in The Biggest Commercial Break of Them All (available on the on-line version), which tells the story about the television program which charted Imagine’s downfall.Briefly, Imagine were one of the most publicity-hungry company’s of their day.  From early 1984 they began publicising their so-called Megagames, Bandersnatch for the Spectrum and Psyclapse for the Commodore 64, and a number of different adverts appeared during the year for the games in the computer press.Imagine had said that they had reached the limit of the capabilities of the Spectrum and planned to release the game with a hardware add-on which would increase the Spectrum's memory.  Various reports suggested that the game would costs anywhere between £20 to £40.The game though was never finished and Imagine collapsed during about the Autumn of 1984.On Games That Weren’t Marc Dawson comments that the Megagames had reached “quite an advanced stage and looked incredible.”The game never appeared despite the fact that Ian Heatherington and Dave Lawson formed a company called Fireiron (nb – I have also seen reports saying this company was called Finchspeed) and planned to release the game for Sinclair Research for the QL either on ROM cartridge or Microdrive.Some of the programmers who worked on Bandersnatch went on to form Denton Designs and their first game Gift from the Gods was described as a “direct descendant” of the ill-fated Megagame.  The central character in Gift was said to be very similar to the one in Bandersnatch.The game also made an appearance for the Atari ST in the guise of Brattacus, released by Psygnosis, a company also formed by messrs Heatherington and Lawson.  Marc Dawson comments on GTW that Brattacus was a mixture of Bandersnatch and Psyclapse.Bangkok Nights – System 3 SoftwareA beat ‘em up which was previewed in issue 14 of Your Sinclair and the August 1988 issue of Sinclair User.  The game was released for the Commodore 64.Batman The Adventure – Ocean SoftwareSimon Butler refers to this game in his ZX Specticle interview.  He says that the game used the same engine as Hunchback The Adventure and was basically an excuse by Ocean to milk the Batman licence.  It was apparently finished but never released.  Of this he comments that it was “no great loss.”  Beaver Bob in Dam Trouble – Christian Urquhart/Gremlin GraphicsThis game was advertised in 1985 by Gremlin and was also the subject of a Crash design the loading screen competition.  Screenshots of the game are featured in July 1985’s issue of Crash in the feature on Gremlin Graphics which contains the following description of the game:“Beaver Bob in Dam Trouble is described by Ian [Stewart], as a game for the slightly younger player, which isn’t to say that it’s easy.  Above the surface of the river, stands a wooden hut with several floors.  This platform section of the game sees Beaver Bob collecting dynamite.  Below the surface of the river are the beaver’s two dams, and a secret hideaway where he keeps food and is able to take a breath.  The river is infested with crocodiles which not only eat beavers, but also steal dam logs.  The object is to replace the stolen logs to keep the level of the reservoir up, whilst avoiding crocodiles, schools of piranha and hunting scuba divers.”Blue Tunnel – Fantasy SoftwareThis was mentioned in the interview in issue 14 of Crash with the artist Steinar Lund, who designed the cover for the game:“I haven’t seen the game…The brief was that it was in a blue tunnel with the red rings which you sort of had to blast away, but I have no clear ideas as to what the game was really like.”Bobajob – Carnell SoftwareThis is mentioned in issue 2 of Your Spectrum.  The game was to be an arcade game and feature the player as a boy scout doing various jobs. Bobby Charlton’s Soccer – DACC LtdConversion of BBC Micro game.  Reported in issue 17 of Your Spectrum,Bobby Yazz Show, The – DestinyThe game was completed and garnered good reviews in Crash, Sinclair User and Your Sinclair.  However, Destiny went out of business and the game was never released.  It did eventually appear as a Crash covertape game.Bob Pape’s unnamed gameHe says on I’ve Started So I’ll Finish that he wrote ¾ of a Colossal Cave type game which was never finished.Borodino – LothlorienWar game mentioned in the article on the company in issue 27 of Crash.Bounty Hunter – Mikro-GenMentioned in T’zers in issue 18 of Your Sinclair.Bug-Byte’s Unnamed Game – Bug-Byte SoftwareFrom issue 5 of Your Spectrum:“Another project currently under wraps at BB is a, so far, unnamed little number where the player guides a person through a 3D world and views a variety of passing objects through their eyes.  Says BB’s Trevor Hall, “We don’t know what the storyline will be yet.  It could be an adventure, or perhaps like Manic Miner, where you have to pick up objects.”  But whatever the theme, the word is the game’s real attraction will be the ability to show objects getting larger as they are approached, and diminishing as our character moves away from them.” Cats – Artic ComputingWritten and reviewed in Sinclair User.  Artic were forced to withdraw the game because of a copyright infringement with the Andrew Lloyd-Weber musical of the same name.  It was slightly re-written and released as Paws.Chameleon – Electric DreamsReported in issue 14 of Your Sinclair.  A Commodore 64 version was released.Channel 8 game – Channel 8 SoftwareYour Spectrum issue 4 reported that Channel 8 were working on a game and trying to secure a licence for one of IPC magazines characters.Chicane – KempstonA racing game based on Formula Ford 2000.  It was mentioned in Sinclair User issue 41.Circus Maximus – LothlorienCircus game mentioned in issue 10 of Your Sinclair.Comic Bakery – ImagineArcade conversion which Imagine advertised at the same time as their other Konami conversions, such as Green Beret.Copter – Omega SoftwareReported in issue 11 of Crash.Corruption – Omega SoftwareReported in issue 11 of CrashCoven – Imagitec/PiranhaPreviewed in issue 71 of Sinclair User.  The game is set on All Hallows Eve.  You play the part of a witch who must take over all 13 witches covens in the world so that they don’t take over the earth.  The preview says, “…the whole thing takes place on broomsticks.  Lots of spells to collect and magic to perform.”Cross Check – DatasoftCrossword puzzle game.  Reported in T’zers in issue 4 of Your Sinclair.Crystal Caverns – Dream SoftwareAdventure game advertised towards the end of 1984 and featured in issue 9 of Your Spectrum.  The report says that the aim of the game is being kept quiet but “the final program will feature a few railway carriages littered about and a ventriloquist’s dummy (who just happens to be a prince who’s been zapped by a spell in some time in the distant past)…”Cyborg – CRLPreviewed in magazines and advertised during 1987.  Daffy Duck – Hi-Tec SoftwareAdvertised in 1992.  Games That Weren’t reports that the Commodore 64 version was completed but Hi-Tec went into liquidation before they could release it.  It’s likely therefore that this was also the fate of the Spectrum version.Dalek Dan – Malcolm Salmon/Starzone SoftwareMentioned in issue 2 of Crash in the article on Starzone.Dan Diamond Trilogy – Salamander SoftwarePlanned conversion of the Dragon games Franklin’s Tomb, Lost in Space and Fishy Business which comprised the trilogy.  The games were to be released as a set for £14.95.  Reported in issue 7 of Your Spectrum.Dante’s Inferno – Beyond SoftwareMentioned in issue 9 of Your Sinclair in the T’zers column.  Beyond did produce a Commodore 64 version of the game.Dark Century – TitusPreviewed in issue 77 of Crash.Dashing Dougie – A & F SoftwareThis game was advertised in the earlier part of 1984.Dave Perry & Chris Hinsley’s Unnamed Game – Mikro-GenDave Perry mentioned in an interview in issue 32 of Crash that he was working on a new game with Chris Hinsley which “concerns bendy cylindrical rubber-like doobries”!Daystar – CRLA Gauntlet clone “with a difference.”  Mentioned in T’zers in issue 16 of Your Sinclair.Death Pit – Clive Townsend/Durell SoftwareThe game was advertised quite extensively in 1985 by Durell and was completed but not considered good enough for release.  An article in issue 25 of Crash remarked: “although halfway through the project there was a moment when it looked like the game might make a commercial release, it didn’t come up to scratch.”  Clive Townsend, however, did use some of the routines from this game in the programming of Saboteur.Defender – AtarisoftI don’t think this was ever advertised by Atarisoft but both issue 2 and 3 of Your Specturm and issue 1 of Crash mentioned that Atarisoft would probably release an official version of the arcade game for the Spectrum.Dempsey and Makepeace – Britannia SoftwareGame based on the television series.  It was advertised in late 1984/early 1985.Denton Designs Unnamed Games – Denton DesignsIssue 36 of Crash revealed that John Heap, of Denton Designs, was working on a game based on ancient Egypt.Staurt Fotheringham reveals on I’ve Started So I’ll Finish that he did “all the graphics in a couple of complete, but unreleased Denton Designs action/strategy games.”Deus Ex Machina – Automata/Electric DreamsIssue 46 of Sinclair User carried a report the Electric Dreams were planning on re releasing this game.Digital Graffiti – Mikro-GenMentioned in T’zers in issue 18 of Your Sinclair.Don Priestly’s  Unnamed GameOn I’ve Started So I’ll Finish he mentions a completed game, the last he worked on, which he sold to Alternative Software at the same time as Up For Grabs:“It was a bouncing ball game, hi res monochrome and consisted of about a dozen “rooms”, with the player looking down.  The ball bounced between the “screen” and the floor.  I can’t remember what it was called…” Dr Who and the Mines of Terror - MicropwerPreviewed quite extensively and much-delayed.  Only the Commodore 64 version was ever released.Dropzone – US Gold (presumably)Classic Atari/Commodore 64 game.  On I’ve Started So I’ll Finish Mark J. Jones says that “I did the graphics for the Speccy version of Dropzone which didn’t come to anything…”Dune – SoftstoneCrash issue 12 reported that Softstone had bought the rights to produce a game based on the book/film Dune.  The player would be “able to choose more arcade or strategy content during play.”Dynamite Dan 2 – 128K version – MirrorsoftMentioned in The Games That Time Forgot on the TZX site.Enchantress – CRLMentioned in issue 13 of Your Sinclair.Eureka 2 – DomarkSequel to Eureka reported in T’zers in Your Sinclair issue 2.Exterminator – Platinum Productions/Software ProjectsMentioned in an interview with Platinum Productions in issue 21 of Crash.  This was a re-written version of their earlier game of the same name written in the style of Robotron.  The article mentions that Software Projects were interested in publishing the game but nothing ever came of it.Eye of the Moon, The – Mike Singleton/MaelstromThe unfinished third game in the would-be Lords of Midnight/Doomdark’s Revenge trilogy.  The games were planned as a trilogy from the start and Eye of the Moon was mentioned as early as issue 5 of Crash.  The plot of the game is given in the instruction booklet of Lords: “The Eye of the Moon is the story of Morkin’s search for the magical jewel which can look into the future…[the adventure] takes place in the warm lands south of Midnight.”Mike Singleton was one of the most famous programmers of the day and was interviewed a number of times by the leading Spectrum magazines.  Naturally, Eye cropped up in a number of interviews.In issue 14 of Crash he mentioned that Eye would be “considerably bigger…[with] more variety in the landscapes”He confirmed in an interview in issue 41 of Crash that he was still working on the game but “not so much as a project, it’s more of a hobby”:“I’ve been constructing some new graphic routines so that the landscaping should be in full colour.  Oh, and the map should be about four times the size of Doomdark’s.”“…the map is divided into 12 realms, and within each realm is a mini-game.  This means that Eye can be played quickly, because you can solve one or two problems, or tackle the whole game…”“With regard to characters, Mike’s intending to have even more in the game than before, but this time a player can select a commander and then make up teams of characters which are controlled as a whole rather than individually.” More revealing, the interview states that there is no date for completion of the game and “It’ll be finished when it’s good and ready.”  Furthermore, he states that it wouldn’t be released by Beyond (who published Lords and Doomdark) or Melbourne House (he was working on the LOTR Arcade Game for them at the time) but by his own company Maelstrom.It seems that whatever the story he got side-tracked with other projects, namely Dark Sceptre, Quake Minus One for the Commodore 64 and two other unreleased games, Star Trek and Lord of the Rings – The Arcade Game.Some of the ideas from the game were used in his later games Midwinter and Citadel.F15 Strike Eagle – US GoldOriginally advertised by US Gold among their first batch of Spectrum releases, the game was eventually released, about two years later, by Microprose.Fergus McNeill’s Unnamed GameHe says on I’ve Started So I’ll Finish that he started work on a Star Wars parody for Level 9 which never came to anything.Fight Night – US GoldThe T’zers column in issue 13 of Your Sinclair mentions that US are working on a conversion of their Commodore 64 boxing game First Night (sic).Fireman game – Malcolm Evans/New Generation SoftwareMalcolm Evans stated in issue 30 of Sinclair User that he was working on a game where you play the role of a fireman: “you have to rescue people and save buildings from destruction.”Flimbo’s Quest – Steve Lamb/System 3 SoftwareAdvertised by System 3 and released on a number of other formats.  On the I’ve Started So I’ll Finish website, the author comments, “My last game I wrote was Flimbo’s Quest.  I’d already converted the C64 version to the Amstrad for System 3, but for various reasons the Speccy version was never published.”Forbidden Planet 128K Version – Design DesignPossible 128K version of the game mentioned in issue 47 of Sinclair User.Fornax & Gath – Gargoyle GamesThe second and third parts in the Siege of Earth Trilogy which began with Marsport.  The games was advertised and scheduled for release in January and April 1986 respectively.The games were shelved when Gargoyle became Faster Than Light and began producing more arcade orientated games.Fort Apocalypse – US GoldA game which originally appeared on the Commodore 64.  Advertised by US Gold among their first batch of proposed Spectrum titles.Frank Bruno’s Boxing – add-on – EliteOn completing the original game, the player gets as a (fabulous) reward a screen featuring an advert for Scooby Doo and for an add-on tape for Frank Bruno “LOOK OUT – Theres (sic) a tape of the worlds (sic) greatest to take you on.”Great European Cross-Country Road Race – ActivisionA Spectrum version of the Commodore 64 game Great American Cross-Country Road Race.  It was mentioned in the interview with Greg Fishbach, then company President of Activision, in issue 21 of Crash.Great Giana Sisters – Rainbow ArtsThe game received excellent reviews in Crash, Sinclair User and Your Sinclair.  However, it was a little to close to Super Mario Bros for comfort and after Nintendo threatened legal action, it was swiftly removed from the market.  Whilst the game was supposedly completed, TZX says that it may in fact only have reached the beta stage.Grog’s Revenge – Dougie Burns (aka Bernie Duggs)/US GoldThis was the sequel to BC’s Quest For Tires which was released in Britain for the Commodore 64.  In an interview on ZX Specticle, Dougie Burns mentions that he was working on the Spectrum version of the game but was taken off the project by Jon Woods.  He says: “I’ll always regret not finishing Grog’s Revenge for US Gold, because it was looking good.”Guerilla War – Ocean or ImaginePlanned conversion of SNK’s coin-op.  Mentioned in the previews section in issue 54 of Crash.Hagar The Horrible – DK’tronicsSinclair User issue 40 reported that DK’tronics had signed a licensing deal to produce a game based on the cartoon character.  The game was supposed to be released in Autumn 1985.Halo Jones – PiranhaAnother potential game mentioned in the article on 2000AD games in issue 47 of Crash.  I’ve never seen the comic strip so I don’t know what it’s about, but the feature states that the aim of the game will be to help the hero to go shopping!Heavy on the Magick – 128K  - Gargoyle GamesReported on the TZX Archive.High Noon – Ocean SoftwareAdvertised in 1984.  Whilst the Spectrum version never saw the light of day, Ocean did release the game for the Commodore 64.Hold the Front Page – MirrorsoftMentioned in issue 46 of Sinclair User.Horace to the Rescue – Melbourne HouseThis would have been the fourth game in the Horace series.  Steve Taylor, a programmer with Melbourne House, mentions in an interview in Crash number 39, that this was the first game he worked on.  The game was never completed though because the project leader suffered a collapsed lung.Hover Bovver – Jeff Minter/Salamander SoftwarePlanned conversion of the Commodore 64 game reported in issue 7 of Your Spectrum.  The conversion of the game is said to be well under-way and the report states that the game should be ready in time for Christmas (1984).Hunchback at the Olympics – Software ProjectsConversion of an obscure arcade game.  It was advertised in 1984 for both Spectrum and Commodore 64.  Only the C64 version was released.Hyper Rally – Konami/Imagine SoftwarePossible arcade conversion reported in both Sinclair User issue 40 and Crash issue 18.Ian Oliver’s unnamed game“I started work on a vertical scrolling game for the Speccy that could do 50 fps, but it never came to anything”: I’ve Started So I’ll Finish interview.Imagine’s other Megagames! – Imagine SoftwareIn a very interesting piece on Games That Weren’t, Marc Dawson mentions that in addition to Bandersnatch and Psyclapse, Imagine were also working on two other Megagames, both to be published for the Spectrum and C64.  Hero by John Heap and Star Raiders by Daryl Dennis.  Both, he says, were working titles. (They are not related to the released games of the same name).Infocom Adventures – Infocom/ActivisionThe July 1987 Sinclair User reported that Activision were considering releasing Infocom’s adventure games for the Plus 3.Inrock – Mosaic PublishingGame based on the book of the same name.  Mentioned in issue 29 of Sinclair User.Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear – Dave Moore & William Tang/Melbourne HouseThe game was completed but never released.  Issue 41 of Crash carried a news article saying that the game would not be released because the programmers, Dave Moore and William Tang, had run into difficulties but that a new game was being programmed from scratch.International Basketball – EliteThe Spectrum conversion of Andew Spencer’s Commodore 64 game.  It was advertised fairly heavily by Elite throughout 1985.  In a feature on Elite in issue 21 of Crash, the game was said to be “nearing completion.”International Events – AncoSports game featuring a diverse range of events: powerboat ski jump, dirt bike trial, cross country, hang gliding, wind surfing and vellodrome.  Advertised and previewed in both Crash and Your Sinclair.International Soccer – EliteMerely Mangram in November 1985’s Crash reported that Elite were supposed to be releasing this game after the company had released International Basketball.Iron Horse – KonamiArcade conversion, advertised by Konami.It’s in Choas – CRLReported in T’zers in issue 1 of Your Sinclair.John Hollis’ Unnamed GameHe mentions on I’ve Started So I’ll Finish that “a horizontal scroller I was writing got shelved.” Jolly Roger – John Cain/Rabbit SoftwareThe first ever report of this game appears in issue 6 of Your Spectrum.  The aim is to find treasure on a ship and you must collect a number of keys to unlock a series of doors.  This is undoubtedly Booty which was released by Firebird.  Presumably when Rabbit went into liquidation the author sold the game to Firebird.Joystick III – The Search for Yaz – Fergus McNeill/Delta 4 SoftwareThe game which would have completed the Quest for the Holy Joystick and Return of the Holy Joystick trilogy.  Mentioned by Fergus McNeill in his interview in issue 45 of Sinclair User.Judge Death – PiranhaHeavily advertised by Piranha and featured in a number of magazine previews.  Crash ran a feature on 2000AD games which Piranha were planning in issue 47 and gave away a free Judge Anderson booklet.  The company, however, went bust before this game could be completed/released.The player would play the role of Judge Anderson who must rid Mega City of the Dark Judges.  Games That Weren’t has a feature on the game.  The Commodore 64 version of the game was actually finished and can be downloaded from their site.  The game is described as a sort of Operation Wolf shoot ‘em up (nb – they refer to the game as Judge Anderson).Junior Kong – Alan Lloyd/Interstella SoftwareIssue 6 of Your Spectrum reported that Alan Lloyd, who had written Defenda, had finished work on this game.  As it happens Defenda was the only game Interstella ever released.Just Imagine – David Lester/R & R SoftwarePlanned release at the end of 1984.  The game was eventually released by Central Solutions.Karateka – US GoldPlanned conversion of the Atari/Commodore 64 game reported in Merely Mangram in the July 1985 issue of Crash.Kimera – OdinMentioned in T’zers in issue 4 of Your Sinclair and issue 20 of Crash which says that it cannot give any clues as to what the game is to be about, save to say that it will be a novel game.Last Ninja , The– System 3 SoftwareThe game was advertised for ages and previewed in most major Spectrum magazines.  Basically, the game ran into a number of problems and System 3 ended up developing and releasing The Last Ninja 2.  Issue 54 of Crash says that the first game was “half written.”Legacy of Light, The – MastervisionFollow-up to the Wrath of Magra which was reported in issue 10 of Your Spectrum.  The game was scheduled for a Spring 1985 launch.Liverpool – GrandslamAdvertised in 1990 for the Commodore 64 and 16 bit machines, the advert stated that the Spectrum and Amstrad versions were “to be confirmed.”  Lothlorien Unnamed GameFeatured in issue 8 of Crash.  Amongst a number of planned games, they are said to be working on a naval Greek war game based on the board game Trirene.Lord of the Rings Parts 2 & 3 – Melbourne HouseThe first Lord of the Rings game was naturally based on the Fellowship of the Rings and was undoubtedly intended as the first adventure in the trilogy, with the other games covering The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  I presume that the remaining games never appeared because Spectrum adventure games were no longer commercially viable.Lord of the Rings – The Arcade Game – Mike Singleton/Melbourne HouseFrom issue 39 of Crash:“This is set during the War of the Ring and you control the Fellowship of the Ring, plus the armies of good.  Meanwhile the computer controls the evil armies and the independent characters.”Mike Singleton gave further details in his interview in issue 41 of Crash a game which: “unlike the adventures, concentrates on the battle scenes.  The player should be able to hold sway over the entire map of Middle Earth, and control all the characters and armies to which they belong.  Fights take place in real-time but, of course, you won’t have a constant view of all the action.“The 3D battles will be displayed in isometric perspective, having characters standing an average 70 pixels high – so there should be about 20 to 30 figures on screen at any one time.  “The control system is a very interesting one,” enthuses Mike.  “It’s possible to give orders by selecting a character to attack, move or help another character.  And don’t worry, a player won’t miss out on any of the fighting as characters are controlled directly – all ready to hack the opposition to pieces.  There’ll be a total of 128 armies, each with a legion of up to 128 men.””Magic Quest – MastertronicMentioned in the feature on Mastertronic in issue 46 of Sinclair User.Magician’s Ball, The – Global SoftwareAdvertised in 1985, the game was described by the company as “enigmatic, enchanting and totally captivating, it’s a weird and wonderful adventure story set to the haunting music of Tubular Bells.  Sheer magic.  With graphics to match.”Mark Haigh-Hutchinson unnamed game – Artic ComputingHe mentions on I’ve Started So I’ll Finish that one of his uncompleted/unreleased games was an arcade adventure game based on Alien which he was writing for Artic.Martin Buller’s Unnamed GameIn issue 8 of Crash in the feature on Design Design, Martin Buller is said to be working on a Pole Position type racing game.Martin Wheeler’s Unnamed GameIn an interview in issue 8 of Crash, he mentions that he has started working on a game:“It’s about this fellow running through the streets with a gun.  I don’t know whether you’ve seen Blade Runner.  Pretty similar to that with dark streets and a man shooting the bad guys.  This man is out hunting some evil being.”Master, The – Software ProjectsAdvertised in late 1984.  The game was never released by Software Projects but Artic did release it as a budget game in 1986.Matthew Smith’s Games – Matthew Smith/Software ProjectsIn an interview in issue 2 of Your Sinclair he mentions he is working on a state of the art game called In Limbo, though it’s likely that he’s having a laugh at the interviewer’s expense.In an interview in the July1987 issue of Sinclair User, he mentioned that in addition to working on Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens from Mars:“I’ve been working on Chickens and also a mega project.  I’ve got the plot worked out and so far I’m up to Chapter 3 in the novella that’s going to come with it.  It’s set in the 24th century and you’ll be able to play the part of anyone in the town where the action takes place.  Basically the machines and bombs and things have become intelligent, and don’t want to be used for war any more.”It is highly unlikely that the game ever got off the drawing board.Megasub Commander – NTD SoftwareMentioned in issue 12 of Crash: “the player assumes the role of the captain of the world’s most advanced submarine – Megasub – and the nerve wracking object is to fend off attacks on the North Atlantic frontiers – by enemy fighters and bombers.  The submarine is equipped with the latest Neutron laser, but it’s one of the hazards of the game that (like its deep space counterparts) the laser is prone to overheating and it requires a cool and level-headed captain to put matters right (that’s where you come in!).  Of course, if you can’t stand the heat and the going gets too tough you can always crash dive – provided there’s sufficient air supply.”Mike Follin’s Unnamed GamesFrom ZX Specticle: “There was something I wrote once that never saw the light of day – it was on 5 ¼ disks, and my drive broke – so I abandoned it lost forever, I’m afraid.”On the I’ve Started So I’ll Finish website he mentions that the last game he was working on was a 3D Robin Hood type of game which he never finished.Mike Singleton’s Unnamed Game – Melbourne HouseThe interview in issue 41 of Crash also mentions that Melbourne House have signed Mike Singleton up to write a few more titles, one of which, is “totally new.  Nothing has been done like it before.”Mikro-Gen Unnamed Game – Mikro-GenFrom issue 8 of Your Spectrum:“Similar in theme to Treasure Island, Mikro-Gen’s latest project will take the player off to a sun-kissed desert island in search of buried treasure.  Exactly what’s buried, Mikro-Gen’s Paul Denial isn’t saying and neither will he let on what hazards are hidden there for the unwary.  Nevertheless, it all sounds as though it could be something rather special, particularly as the player will only be seeing a sixty-fourth of the island at any one time…”The game was scheduled for release in October 1984.Mikro-Plus Games – Mikro-GenIssue 20 of Your Spectrum reported that Shadow of the Unicorn  was the first of what would probably be a series of games to use the Mikro-Plus add-on.  After the poor sales, however, of Shadow, no further games were released.Milk Tray TV advert game – SoftstoneCrash 12 reports that Sofstone have obtained the rights to produce a game based on the Milk Tray TV advert.Mind Pursuit – DatasoftTrivial Pursuit type game.  Reported in T’zers, Your Sinclair issue 4.Mire Mare – Ultimate Play The GameAt the end of Underwurlde, the player can escape through three different exits.  Each exit then names a different game in which Sabreman is to take part.  The first two are Knight Lore and Pentagram.  The third is Mire Mare.  The TZX archive contains a picture of the Mire Mare exit.  Staurt Campbell in his article The Games Time Forgot, in the last ever issue of Your Sinclair, comments that the game probably never got past the stage of being a title and this seems to be the general opinion of the game’s status.  However, the Ultimate Appreciation website has an interview with an ex-employee of Ultimate who confirms that the game did in fact exist.  He says “code for this [Mire Mare] exists” and “It does exist.  I have seen it.  I have played it.”The story apparently is that Mire Mare was coded before Gunfright.  Chris and Tim Stamper were planning to sell out to US Gold and wanted to keep Mire Mare back as a Grand Finale so Gunfright was released first.However, the sell out was completed more quickly than first thought.  US Gold wanted to put Ultimate’s back catalogue of games out on their budget label, Kixx and approached Chris and Tim Stamper  asking where Mire Mare was as they wanted to put it out on the Kixx label as well.  The Stampers weren’t impressed with US Gold and told them Mire Mare wasn’t ready (“although basically it was”).Mirrorsoft’s Unnamed Game – MirrosoftT’zers in issue 3 of Your Sinclair reports that Mirrorsoft are working on a Knight Lore type game set underwater.Mizar Unnamed Game – Richard Woodward & Robert Waller/MizarIssue 15 of Crash carried a feature on Mizar who had recently released Out of the Shadows, which as it turns out, was the only game they ever released.  Comment is made in the interview on the new game they are working on:“The next game Mizar will be releasing is going to incorporate a naturalistic landscape, displayed from a projection.  The closer you get to, say, a coastline, the more detail you will see…”“…their next game, an extension of Out of the Shadows, will incorporate state-of-the-art graphics techniques which no-one else has thought of bringing to the Spectrum – or been able to!”““We’ll certainly be taking the graphics several stages further and they will include a naturalisitc projection of views of the playing environment; the intelligence of your adversaries will also be upgraded…””“”In our next game we plan to computerise the Dungeon Master in effect – keeping the rules and regulations of the game as minimal as possible to allow the player to get involved in the game itself.  You can play the part of the main character, or protagonist, and will be in an environment where other lead characters exist who have their own aims and definite objectives.  You will be competing against each other, and at times working together, all using common resources in the game environment.”Moon Patrol – AtarisoftThe game was featured by Atarisoft in the adverts as being one of the range of games which they were converting for the Spectrum.  The game was completed but never released.Murder on the Atlantic – InfogramesMentioned in T’zers, issue 18 of Your Sinclair and previewed in Crash issue 41:“the era is the late thirties, and you’re a police superintendent taking a well-earned break aboard the Atlantic line Bourgogne.  However, a foul murder is committed soon after the ship leaves New York, and it’s up to you to find the guilty party before the cruise ends in Europe.  More foul play occurs throughout the trip, and the pace speeds up when you realise that the outcome of the Second World War depends on your successful solution!”Nimrod – Gremlin GraphicsReported in issue 18 of Your Sinclair:“…Nimrod’s a friendly little alien, a member of a very friendly race of robots called the Bioptons, who like parties and firing off fire extinguishers just like any normal person.  Naturally the evil Cratons don’t like this sort of thing, so they crash the Bioptons’ party (really wild by all accounts – lots of clanking noises from the darker corners) and imprison them individually on space prisons stretched across the galaxy.  Seems a bit harsh - most gatecrashers I know just drink all the booze and frighten the cat.  Nimrod’s the only one to get away from this all-nighter and he has to rescue all his comrades.  And he’s got only 99 eons to do it in.”Nodes of Yesod – First version – OdinOn I’ve Started So I’ll Finish, Staurt Fotheringham reveals that the programmers of Nodes lost the code when a Microdrive they were storing it on crashed.  The game had to be completed in a rush with the result that the “final version wasn’t as good as our original”.Old Scores – Global SoftwareAdvertised in 1985, the game is “an adventure of mystery and suspense based around the London South Bank.”  Global described the game in their advert as “Cryptic from the start.  Old Scores is a mystery to everyone.  Even I haven’t got a clue what it’s about.  So it sounds as if you’ll have to play it by ear.”  It was also mentioned in issue 20 of Your Spectrum,On Court Tennis – ActivisionConversion of Commodore 64 game.  Reported in issue 4 of Your Sinclair in T’zers.On the Tiles – Odin SoftwareReported in T’zers in issue 13 of Your Sinclair.One Man and His Droid 2 – Clive BrookerFollow-up to One Man and His Droid.  The game was written but the author was unable to find a publisher for it.  Full details are given on Clive Brooker’s website.  Basically, he sent it to a number of publishers but none were interested.  Virgin Mastertronic advised him that the game was very good but publishing Spectrum software was no longer commercially viable.Pacman – DJL SoftwareThs story behind this game is in issue 3 of Your Spectrum.  Briefly, DJL had written a version of Pacman which they intended to release in their own right.  The game was, however, bought by Atarisoft, who released this version as their own official conversion.Parker cartridge games – ParkerParker had some success releasing cartridge games based on arcade classics, such as Star Wars, in the very early days of the Commodore 64.  There was a fair bit of excitement when they announced in 1984 that they would be releasing five games on Interface 2 cartridge for the Spectrum, namely: Stars Wars, Return of the Jedi, Popeye, Q*Bert and Gyruss.  An article in issue 4 of Your Spectrum stated that the games should be ready by June/July 1984 and released in August.  Apparently, however, because of the cost and lack of uptake of the Interface 2, the games were never released.Pete Cooke’s GamesHe mentions a couple of games in an interview in issue 42 of Crash.  The first is a 3D type arcade adventure.  The second is a parallax scrolling shoot ‘em up.Phantom of the Opera - CSDPlanned tie in with Andrew Lloyd-Weber’s musical.  “Gameplay takes place against a background of famous Paris landmarks, in the city’s sewers and in the Paris Opera House where the disfigured musician stalks his prey”: Sinclair User issue 47.Pit, The/Vortex – Rabbit SoftwareIssue 4 of Your Spectrum reported that Rabbit were working on this game which had the working title of The Pit but which would probably end up being called something like Vortex.   “The game is set in a cavern with the player taking control of a ship.  Among the obstacles will be witches, bunnies, ghosts, televisions and funny white blobs.”  Rabbit went into liquidation before the game could be released.  From the description, it sounds very much like the game which was eventually released as Exodus by Firebird.Plasmatron – CRLA space shoot ‘em up reported in issue 19 of Your Sinclair.P.L.O.D. – Dougie Burns (aka Bernie Duggs)/OdinThe last game which the author worked on for the Spectrum.  He comments on the ZX Specticle website that the game was terrible so this was why it was never released.Pole Position 2 – DatasoftReported in T’zers in issue 4 of Your Sinclair.Poltergeist – PSSPSS advertised this game at the same time as the much delayed Swords and Sorcery.Popeye – Unreleased version – DK’tronicsPopeye was advertised for a long time by DK’tronics prior to its release.  Don Priestley revealed the reason for this in his interview in issue 34 of Crash: “a version of Popeye had already been written by AN Other and it was duff – a platform and ladders game.  I was asked to do it again.”Pyramid Power – MartechReported in T’zers in issue 16 of Your Sinclair.Quake Minus One – Mike Singleton/MonolithThe game was released for the Commodore 64 only but a report in issue 39 of Sinclair User seems to suggest that a Spectrum version was also in production.Quest for Knowledge – Channel 8 SoftwareReported in Your Spectrum issue 8:“…the program features caricatures of all the school’s teachers, and a mischievous pupil known as Brainy Brian who proves a magnet for their unwelcome attention.  The game begins with a number of empty brains, and the idea is to move around the school, collecting books and tokens in order to accumulate knowledge; thus, the brains are gradually filled.  Once a certain level has been achieved, the brain in question will then be ready to gain the relevant “O” level.  Brian, on the other hand, seems content simply to cause the teachers and his fellow pupils the maximum aggravation.”The game was said to be based on a real school!Raffles – St BridesMentioned in issue 45 of Sinclair User in the feature on St Brides.Realtime Software Unnamed Games – Realtime SoftwareIssue 29 of Crash carried a feature on Realtime.  They are said to be working on two games.  The first is a three dimensional game in which the lead character is marooned on a planet and has to collect various objects in order to find a way off.  No details are given about the second game.Re-Bounder – Gremlin GraphicsThe follow up to Bounder was released by Gremlin for the Commodore 64.  The game was previewed in the June 1987 issue of Sinclair User.River Raider – Starzone SoftwareMentioned in issue 2 of Crash in the feature on Starzone.Robotron 2084 – Paul Holmes/AtarisoftAnother Atarisoft game that was advertised and completed but never published.  The author states on the I’ve Started So I’ll Finish website that Atarisoft went under before the game could be released.Romik games – RomikIn a feature in issue 12 of Crash they mention they are going to release a number of games for the Spectrum in Spring 1985.  In fact, Beatcha which was released around Christmas 1984, was their last ever Spectrum release.Samurai Dawn – Faster Than LightAdvertised in 1986.Sattelite Wars (SDI) – MartechReported in issue 16 of Your Sinclair.Scary Monsters – Odin SoftwareReported in T’zers in issue 13 of Your Sinclair.Schizofrenia – QuicksilvaAdvertised in 1985.  Quicksilva did release a version for the Commodore 64.Search for Sharla, The – ThalamusThe game was advertised in 1990.  There is an interesting piece about the game on the Games That Weren’t website.  Whatever coding was done on the game appears to have been done for the C64, Atari ST and Amiga and it seems that the Spectrum version of the game was of much lower priority.The game was previewed in Zzap! 64 in 1989:“Set in a Lords of Midnight-style world, using landscaping techniques, Sharla’s play area is made up of twelve moons, each moon having individual landscapes, caverns, dungeons and quests.  There are an incredible 512 interactive characters walking around under a sky which slowly moves between night and day.”The site has interviews with the programmers who worked on the C64 version.  Different reasons are given as to why the game was never finished.  Steve Day says that Thalamus pulled the plug on the game as it ran over budget and time and Thalamus lost patience.  Lance Mason says that they were asked to re-write the graphics in the game and received only part of the promised additional payment for this, so the game was shelved.The novella for the game was completed and is available from GTW.September – ActivisionA board/puzzle game previewed in issue 71 of Sinclair User:“September is all about trying to make a line from one side of the board to the other using T shapes, L shapes, straight bits and U turns.  Two players can take part (or you and the computer) and you start at right angles to each other on the board.  The trick is working out how you can both further your progress across the board, and scupper your opponent’s attempts to reach the other side.”Issue 73 of Sinclair User then reported that the game had been shelved.Sewer, The – Design DesignMentioned in T’zers in issue 19 of Your Sinclair.Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery - EliteA much-hyped game, Elite first started advertising this from around Autumn 1985.  The advert billed the game as “the first ever computer cartoon” and featured some mouth watering screenshots.  The game was to be similar to the laser disc arcade games such as Dragon’s Lair.  Issue 21 of Crash carried a full preview of the game.The game was to feature all the characters from the cartoon and was set in a Scottish castle owned by Shaggy’s anutie.  The castle is haunted and Scooby and the gang have 48 hours to solve the mystery.The game is said to “feature seven or eight action sequences which are separated by descriptive scenes in which characters in the game interact by meeting together and having a chat…”“In the action sequences you will follow Scooby and Shaggy as they search the castle and need to help them solve (or avoid) problems as they arise and generally guide them on their way.  You drive the action in the game, acting rather like a film director, taking decisions which affect the outcome of events.  After each action sequence has been played through, the scene will fade to a descriptive section where you eavesdrop on conversations and can pick up clues, tips and hints which will help you solve the mystery.”The game was scrapped as the Spectrum was not capable of handling such an ambitious project.  Issue 47 of Sinclair User reported: “while the graphics in the game …are supposedly unbelievable the game is a shambles.  Lack of memory has been blamed for the failure to release the game.”  Elite were, however, supposedly considering releasing the game for the 128K Spectrum.Faster Than Light then developed the game for Elite, a much more conventional platform and ladders game, which was released towards the end of 1986.The game did spawn the Scooby Award in the Gremlin column of Sinclair User which was given to much-delayed games!Sigue Sigue SputnikFrom Stuart Campbell’s article in the last issue of Your Sinclair:“”The 5th Generation of Computer Games” was the promise made in the between-tracks advert on fabulous pop band Sigue Sigue Sputnik’s debut LP.  “The Sigue Sigue Sputnik Computer Game – from you favourite software house NOW”, the ad continued, hence somewhat giving the game away.  This one never made it further than a couple of mock-up C64 screenshots, which is a real shame.  Yes it is.”Ski Champ – New ConceptsFollow-up to Surf Champ.  Mentioned in T’zers, Your Sinclair issue 3.Skool Daze 3 – Dave Reidy/MicrosphereThe February 1986 issue of Crash carried an interview with Dave Reidy, the author of Skool Daze and Back To Skool.  He mentions that Back To Skool is the second program in a trilogy and that clues to the new Skool game are hidden in Back To Skool.  I looked very carefully in BTS for clues about this game.  Whilst Boy Wander is in the habit of writing on the blackboards “Who is Sam Cruise?” (an obvious reference to Contact Sam Cruise, released later that year) there are no clues whatsoever about a further Skool Daze game.Smirking Horror, The – Fergus McNeill/Delta 4 SoftwarePresumably this would have been a parody of Infocom’s The Lurking Horror.  The game was started but never completed.  Snark – Gargoyle GamesGame based on Lewis Carroll’s poem The Hunting of the Snark.  Reported in issue 12 of Your Sinclair.Solar Jetman – StormThe game caused much excitement when it was previewed in Crash in issue 86.  This would have been Jetman’s third adventure, following on from the all-time classics of Jet Pac and Lunar Jetman.  I don’t know what stage the Spectrum version reached but Games That Weren’t mentions that the Commodore 64 version was completed but Storm did not release it as they didn’t think it was suitable for the C64 market!  The game was released on the NES however.Sotftek adventure games – SoftekIssue 1 of Crash reported that Softek were working on a series of adventure games for the Spectrum.Space Doubt – CRLThe article in issue 19 of Crash on CRL reports that they are working on a Spectrum conversion of this Commodore 64 game:“The action takes place on a huge spaceship with animated backgrounds, and it has an unusual way of presenting the 3D.  It’s as though the ship had been chopped through in the middle so that each room you enter is seen like a stage set.  Walking off “the front” switches you into the other half of the room.  There are null gravity lifts and room doors that slide up and down, but as most of the ship’s workings have been badly affected by a space storm, their working is very erratic.  The object…is to get the ship and cargo safely to its destination against all odds, which include plenty of nasties as well as external influences.  Through the various window ports the stars can be seen in movement, which tells you which way you are going as well as giving an indication of your orientation on the vessel.”Spearhead – Simon Golding/CRLA helicopter shoot ‘em up reported in issue 19 of Your Sinclair.Spinning Around Game – Design DesignA working title of a game being worked on by Design Design when they were featured in issue 8 of Crash.  It may be that this was the game finally released as Forbidden Planet.Squidgy Alien Golf – CRLMentioned in T’zers, Your Sinclair issue 13.Stainless Steel Rat – Mosaic PublishingGame based on the book of the same name.  Mentioned in issue 29 of Sinclair User.Starforce 1 – Carnell SoftwareIn late 1983/early 1984 Carnell Software ran an advertisement which appeared in most computer magazines of the day featuring their range of games.  Part of the advertisement featured the game Starforce 1.  The advertising blurb said: “Take on the robot guardians of the central computer in a superbly stylised three dimensional battle game.”  According to issue 2 of Your Spectrum the game was to be the first of a number of Starforce games and was to feature the player at the edge of a maze with the aim being to get to the centre and destroy the computer.  According to the article, however, the game was dreadful.  Apparently the directors of Carnell, gave the programmer an ultimatum to produce a better game and whilst he did, nothing was ever heard again of the Starforce game(s).Starship – Jon Ritman & Bernie DrummondJon Ritman and Bernie Drummond started work on this game after they completed Match Day II.  However, after they had partially written it, they received an offer to work for Rare, so the game was never finished.  Starship appears to have only been a working title for the game.In Graeme Kidd’s interview with Jon Ritman in Your Sinclair, the interviewer had some interesting observations on the game:“Starship looks well impressive, even at the stage at which it reached before being abandoned…A flying saucer zooms along above a smoothly-scrolling tessellated landscape, a landscape that forms a globe and is complete with hills and mountains.  The playing area is huge – flying at full pelt in one direction, you go for about 45 seconds before circling the globe.  Starship had the makings of a great game – you were going to be able to travel across the landscape in a variety of vehicles, hunting for treasures and entering buildings to buy and sell equipment.”Starship – OutlawI must admit I had never seen this article until I read the scan on the TZX archive which announces the new company and says their first release will be Starship.  Is this the famous Jon Ritman game they are talking about or a completely different game?  Four questions spring to mind:According to the Graeme Kidd interview (above) JR and BD did not appear to have any intention of completing Starship.The announcement lists a number of programmers who Outlaw have signed up but makes no reference to JR or BD.Would Ocean not have released the game if it was completed?BUT – was there another game floating about at the time also with the name of Starship?Very interesting!Star Trek – Mike Singleton/Beyond SoftwareThe game based on the film Star Trek IV.  I don’t think it was ever advertised but it was fairly heavily previewed and was mentioned a number of times in Sinclair User.  One of the revolutionary features of the game was that it was going to feature digitised pictures of the crew members faces!  An Atari ST version of the game was released.Ste Cork’s unreleased games.A fairly prolific programmer, he gave an interview to the I’ve Started So I’ll Finish website.  He lists a number of games he has written, including Deadzone and Elephant Polo which to my knowledge weren’t commercially released.He also states that he has working on a couple wargames which got shelved and several earlier games that got put to one side for a while because of work demands on other projects and were never picked up again.
When asked if he left any games unfinished he says that he was working on a game with the working title Encounter: “a huge starship-deck-plan strategy wargame got “temporarily” shelved.”Stellar Holocaust – Peter Campoulani & Dave Selwood/LothlorienAn animated adventure mentioned in issue 27 of Crash.Street Hawk – Nigel Alderton/Ocean SoftwareAround 1985/86 Ocean secured some pretty dodgy licences and succeeding in producing some terrible games (Knight Rider and Miami Vice spring immediately to mind).  The Street Hawk game was advertised from around mid-1985 by Ocean.  Crash had also offered the game free as one of their subscription offers in 1985.  As it happens this was the first game which was produced and it had nothing whatsoever to do with the television series!  Basically, the game is a sort of Defender clone with absolutely terrible flickering graphics.  The Crash readers who were unfortunate enough to choose this game did receive it but it was never released commercially.  Ocean continued advertising the game throughout 1986 and it finally made release around the end of that year.  Whilst the second game did have a lot more in common with the television series, it was still fairly dreadful.Supercharger – Nial Mardon/Starzone SoftwareIn the feature on Starzone in issue 2 of Crash, Nial Mardon, the author of Zaxxan, mentions he is working on a Pole Position type game with the name Supercharger:“…he is aiming for a highly playable game incorporating features like humpback bridges, tunnels with only headlamps seen, a suspension bridge, hills, bends, an ambulance to watch out for, and the best 3D perspective view yet seen.  There will be a hi and lo gear change with ice on the road as an extra hazard to the other cars.  He’s also looking into the possibility of rain…”Superman – Beyond SoftwareMuch-hyped game.  It was dreadful and ended up being released by Prism Lesuire as a budget game.Sweeney, The – DK’tronicsCrash reported in issue 10 that DK’tronics had signed a licensing deal with Thames Television to produce games based on Minder, Benny Hill and The Sweeney.  Whilst both Minder and Benny Hill were released, this game never materialised.  Swordmaster Series – Steve JacksonAdvertised in early 1985.Sword of the Samurai – US Gold/AdventuresoftMentioned in T’zers in issue 16 of Your Sinclair and the September 1986 issue of Crash carried a preview of the game.Swords and Sorcery 2 (Heroquest) – PSSAdvertised in issue 11 of Your Sinclair.  T’zers in issue 14 of Your Sinclair also reported that PSS were working on this game, the follow up to Swords and Sorcery.System 1500 2 – Lee KristoffersonIn an interview in issue 35 of Sinclair User he states that “he has every intention of writing a sequel to System 1500 which would involve getting your revenge on the computer criminals by defrauding them.”Tebbit, The – Applications SoftwareThis was to be a politcal satire in the style of The Hobbit.  The game was advertised by Applications along with their game Denis Through The Drinking Glass.  The description of the game was thus:“Join the magical quest for the elusive monetarist dream, in which you, a humble Tebbit must seek the assistance of Magdalf and Tomkin-Gee, to find and defeat the ferocious (and balding) Scarg.The Games That Weren’t website states that there are two rumours why this game was never released: the first being that the game was finished but withdrawn because of poor sales of Denis.  The second is that the game was considered too sensitive after the bombing in 1984 of the Conservative party conference when Norman Tebbit was injured.  They say, though, that this second reason is unlikely as Applications’ adverts disappeared from magazines around May 1984 when the bombing didn’t take place until October 1984.Thing, The – Jonathan SmithIn an interview on the ZX Specticle website, Jonathan Smith mentions that this was the first ever game he wrote but it was never released.  The games was a Donkey Kong clone.Three and In – Jon Ritman/Bernie Drummond/Chris Clarke/Ocean SoftwareThis game was first mentioned in an interview with Jon Ritman in issue 33 of Crash:“The men who brought you Match Day are currently working on a football simulation which has the working title Three and In because the gameplay follows the rules of Three and In!  Bernie Drummond has been roped in to help on the graphics and Chris and Jon hope to have the game ready in time for this Christmas [1986].  There will be two players to each side, and the animations are going to be large.  At the start, the first task is to pick your team – the computerised footballers each have their own playing and passing skills, and the choice of players will influence the outcome of the game.  One, two or three people will be able to play.  It’s early days in the development at the moment – but Jon is keen to get as much realistic detail into the game as possible: the players will run around looking behind them for instance.“I wanted to incorporate machine intelligence into Three and In, Jon explained, “but I was scared to begin with.  Then I sorted out a few lines of code which basically instructed the computer player to run for the ball and then kick it.  Thirty seconds after the little program had been loaded, it scored a goal against me.  I laughed for fifteen minutes…”The game is mentioned further an in interview in issue 38 of Crash with Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummond:“The batch of Bernie’s computer graphics should seen the light on day on Three and In.  The game is being written by Chris Clarke, Jon’s old Match Day collaborator.  Chris has been working on the game since he and Jon finished Match Day.  It’s based on the old playground game where some poor sap would be stuck in goal, and his mates would try to score goals.  The first to score three goals changed places.For Three and In, Chris plans to allow up to three players to compete at once, one controlling the goalkeeper and the two others taking the defence and attack – controlling two footballers each.  When Bernie started working on the game, Chris had the figures moving and Bernie got involved with “filling them out” – giving them convincing arms and legs.The screen will look similar to the end-on view of Handball Maradonna and Footballer of the Year “but hopefully there will be lots more gameplay,” Bernie asserts.Three Days in Carpathia – Ram Jam CorporationThe follow-up to Valkyrie 17.  Games That Weren’t reports that Three Days was to be a text adventure using character set screens livened up with moving sprites including a dodo which fixated on you as Mother when it hatched.  All the words were in Carpathian until you found a dictionary.Tilt – LinelPreviewed by never released.Toki – Ocean SoftwareArcade conversion.  The game was advertised by Ocean and previewed in issue 90 of Crash.  It was released on other formats but the Spectrum version never appeared.Trashman in Time – Malcolm Evans/New Generation SoftwareNot an official title but it seems that New Generation were planning some sort of follow up to Travel With Trashman as the end of the game displays a message ""Time machine found in…(then the name of the location where you finish the game).”Traxxion – CRLReported in issue 16 of Your Sinclair – “you’re a reactor in space travelling round a military monorail on a train that’s unstoppable.  All you can do is shoot the points to change directions.”Trials of Therias – Gargoyle GamesReported in T’zers in issue 12 of Your Sinclair.  Gargoyle are said to be working on this game, which is is the sequel to Heavy on the Magick.Troll – OutlawAdvertised by Outlaw.  The game was eventually released by Kixx.Troopa Truck – Rabbit SoftwareA Commodore 64 version of Moon Patrol.  Lloyd’s Lookback in issue 12 of Crash mentioned that Rabbit were working on a Spectrum version of the game before their demise.Up ‘n’ Down – US GoldConversion of the Sega coin up which did make commercial release in Britain for the Commodore 64.  US Gold advertised the game in a double page advert with other games such  as Tapper and Spy Hunter as being the first batch of American titles which they were releasing over here.Valhalla 2 – LegendThis sequel was mentioned in Sinclair User issue 41 in the feature on Legend.  The game, it was said, would comprise of “mixed icons and text.”Vandal – Alligata SoftwareReported in T’zers in issue 9 of Your Sinclair.Ventamatic games – VentamaticIssue 6 of Crash reported Ventamatic were planning to release a number of games for the Spectrum.  Of those reported, Crazy Climber, The Builder and Martian Tunnels were never released.Vis – Dean Belfield/Ben JacksonMentioned in the ZX Specticle interview with Dean Belfield. The game was finished but they were unable to find a publisher for it.  Warlock – Electric DreamsMentioned in T’zers in Your Sinclair 10.Web, The – OrpheusReported in issue 5 of Your Sinclair.Westminster – Mr Chip SoftwareYour Spectrum issue 4 states that Mr Chip Software were working on a conversion of their Commodore 64 game, Westminster.Where Hobbits Dare – Melbourne HouseThe T’zers column in Your Sinclair was normally fairly reliable but this game, mentioned in issue 14, sounds fairly implausible.Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race – Melbourne HouseIn an article on Melbourne House in Crash issue 23, the company are reported to be working on this game.Willy Meets The Taxman – Matthew Smith/Software ProjectsThe game is also known as The Megatree, which appears to be the name under which it would have been released.The game was first mentioned in the March 1984 of Personal Computer Games: “After another skiing trip Matthew expects to start thinking about a follow up to Jet Set Willy – perhaps to be called Willy Meets The Taxman.”Issue 31 of Sinclair User also mentioned the game stating that “it involves our hero trying to avoid paying tax on his gains from Jet Set Willy.”This was taken up by Sinclair User in their interview with Matthew Smith in issue 33: “Rumours abound that the next game is Willy Meets The Taxman with Willy forced to pay up for his Jet Set Willy lifestyle.  No decisions have been taken, says Alan [Maton].”The news section in the same issue also stated:“Matthew Smith and company direction Alan Maton are still thinking about what should go into the game.  Smith has some very definite ideas but only a few of them are printable.  “Somewhere in the game we are going to have an Alice in Wonderland character.”  He says that there are some problems with that idea.  “You can show a voluminous skirt in 16x16 pixels very well but you can’t have any features.””  It was also reported that the game would come with a hardware add-on and was scheduled for Spring 1985 release.The best information about the game comes from the interview with programmer Stuart James Fotheringham on the I’ve Started So I’ll Finish page:Q – “You were working on Manic Miner 3 with Matthew Smith – what was he and the game like?”A – “I worked, and partied, with Matthew a lot in 1984 during my time a Software Projects Ltd in Liverpool.  Matthew, Marc Dawson and myself were developing The Megatree.  Matthew had worked on a third Miner Willy for months, but had really done nothing (his recreational activities prevented him from concentrating for periods longer than a few seconds).Alan Maton was the producer, Matthew was the designer/director, Marc was the programmer and I was the graphics artist – you may be shocked to know that were were developing for the Commodore 64, with a  Spectrum third-party conversion to follow…Marc and I were brought in to help Matthew deliver something, anything, to meet the demand for a third Miner Willy game.  Our project was cancelled after three months – all we had delivered was a single screen.  The Mega Tree was a pseudo-3D raised view , rather than a sideways view game. with scrolling as well as fixed screen levels.  Miner Willy started at the bottom of the main access screen, he had been redesigned to look like more Mario (we all loved Donkey Kong) and ran to the top of the screen where there was excessive foliage and trees (inspired by Sabre Wulf).  On his way up the screen Willy had to avoid “running and Cossack dancing” oak trees – they were great.  In the centre of the foliage was the Ban Yan tree extending off the top of the screen, and either side were three paths into the forest.  The idea was that Willy had to complete the six areas (in any order) by going down these paths, via this screen, collect enough flashing pound notes and then climb the Ban Yan tree – where the next access screen, with another set of paths off, would be.Thinking back, The Mega Tree was quite a similar concept to the later Super Mario Bros games on the NES, although you could also run “in to” (up) and “out of” (down) the screen. “Wonder Girl – St BridesMentioned in issue 26 of Crash and issue 45 of Sinclair User.World Cup Carnival – unreleased version – US GoldThe explanation which US Gold gave for the World Cup Carnival fiasco (re-releasing an ancient Artic game at twice the price for anybody who can’t remember) was that they had commissioned a programmer to write an original game but the game was terrible and they did not have enough time to have a new game written before the World Cup.  They must therefore be a completed unreleased version of WCC floating about somewhere.Word Seeker/Super Bandit – SoftstoneMentioned in issue 12 of Crash.Zarjazz – AriolasoftShoot ‘em up reported in issue 14 of Your Sinclair.Zone, The – Arcade SoftwareThis was advertised throughout 1984 by Arcade Software, normally in an advert that featured their other games, such as The Detective, Bubble Trouble, Raider of the Cursed Mine and Last Sunset for Lattica.  The game was billed thus:“So far you have raced for your life against android cars: you have been stranded miles underground searching for diamonds, you have taken on the mafia single handed and saved a planet for extinction.…Now in our latest game you are a burglar in search of loot – in hot pursuit are the most fearful security force ever assembled!Even if you survive all this – beyond, lies the terror of The Zone!!”Zone 49 – Procom SoftwareIssue 14 of Crash carried an interview with artist Steinar Lund.  No details of the game are given, but there is a picture of the artwork for the game with the words underneath that the game is called Zone 49 by Procom which was unpublished."

25,documents/fw4.pdf,finance,good,"Form W-4 (2015)Purpose. Complete Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your pay. Consider completing a new Form W-4 each year and when your personal or financial situation changes. Exemption from withholding. If you are exempt, complete only lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 and sign the form to validate it. Your exemption for 2015 expires February 16, 2016. See Pub. 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. Note. If another person can claim you as a dependent on his or her tax return, you cannot claim exemption from withholding if your income exceeds $1,050 and includes more than $350 of unearned income (for example, interest and dividends).Exceptions. An employee may be able to claim exemption from withholding even if the employee is a dependent, if the employee: • Is age 65 or older,Is blind, orWill claim adjustments to income; tax credits; or itemized deductions, on his or her tax return.The exceptions do not apply to supplemental wages greater than $1,000,000. Basic instructions. If you are not exempt, complete the Personal Allowances Worksheet below. The worksheets on page 2 further adjust your withholding allowances based on itemized deductions, certain credits, adjustments to income, or two-earners/multiple jobs situations.Complete all worksheets that apply. However, youmay claim fewer (or zero) allowances. For regular wages, withholding must be based on allowances you claimed and may not be a flat amount or percentage of wages. Head of household. Generally, you can claim head of household filing status on your tax return only if you are unmarried and pay more than 50% of the costs of keeping up a home for yourself and your dependent(s) or other qualifying individuals. See Pub. 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information, for information. Tax credits. You can take projected tax credits into account in figuring your allowable number of withholding allowances. Credits for child or dependent care expenses and the child tax credit may be claimed using the Personal Allowances Worksheet below. See Pub. 505 for information on converting your other credits into withholding allowances.Nonwage income. If you have a large amount of nonwage income, such as interest or dividends, consider making estimated tax payments using Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals. Otherwise, you may owe additional tax. If you have pension or annuity income, see Pub. 505 to find out if you should adjust your withholding on Form W-4 or W-4P. Two earners or multiple jobs. If you have a working spouse or more than one job, figure the total number of allowances you are entitled to claim on all jobs using worksheets from only one Form W-4. Your withholding usually will be most accurate when all allowances are claimed on the Form W-4 for the highest paying job and zero allowances are claimed on the others. See Pub. 505 for details. Nonresident alien. If you are a nonresident alien, see Notice 1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens, before completing this form. Check your withholding. After your Form W-4 takes effect, use Pub. 505 to see how the amount you are having withheld compares to your projected total tax for 2015. See Pub. 505, especially if your earnings exceed $130,000 (Single) or $180,000 (Married). Future developments.

Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanGood morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. By now, you've likely seen our announcement on the appointment of Justin Keppy as our new Chief Operating Officer, effective November 15th. Justin joins us from Carrier Corporation, where he led a multibillion-dollar division. He's a strong leader with experience in both the private sector and the U.S. military. Justin is a graduate of West Point and Harvard Business School, and I look forward to closely working with him as he leads the day-to-day execution of our business.With that, I will now turn to our results for the third quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, representing the highest quarterly reported revenue in the company's history. Revenue grew 8% versus 1 year ago and 11% sequentially. Volume, as measured by transaction days were strong, up 16% versus Q3 of last year and up 9% sequentially. Demand in the quarter was strong across our business with leisure, corporate and rideshare volumes all up year-over-year, demonstrating the continued strength of the traveling consumer.Of note, our rideshare volume was up 50% year-over-year with sequential growth of 12%. Pricing improved sequentially, but was down year-over-year against elevated levels in 2022. While the sequential move up of just over 2% trailed our expectations from an industry perspective, market shares appeared stable in the quarter amidst relatively stable pricing among our major competitors. We believe that various inflationary factors will continue to support tighter fleets and more elevated rates versus those historically experienced in the industry, all consistent with our ROA focus.As we move through October, which is showing ongoing strength in leisure across North America as well as Europe, we still maintain that year-over-year declines will moderate from here. In all, leisure bookings remain strong, inbound travel is increasing and rideshare is growing on what we believe are the attractive economics to drivers of renting cars from Hertz. Given the focus on pricing, let me make one additional point on rate to help reconcile RPD being up 2%, while large segments of our business were up higher, as I will speak to in a moment. There are customer channels in our business like leisure, which are subject to more dynamic market pricing. There are also channels like rideshare and insurance replacement where rate is more fixed or contractual in nature.Just focusing on pricing in our North American leisure business, the largest by transaction days, RPD in that channel was up more than 6% over the prior quarter, excluding the dilutive impact of EVs. By comparison, RPD and our more fixed rate businesses in North America was roughly flat sequentially and therefore, drove the system-wide number lower to plus 2%.Let me reflect on the cost side of the equation. Our adjusted corporate EBITDA in Q3 was $359 million, reflecting a 13% margin. While this trend trailed our expectations, our performance still reflected strong demand, higher sequential RPD, a stable industry environment and improving operating fundamentals across the company. Our direct operating expenses remained controlled in the quarter as they grew with transaction volume.On a unit basis, we achieved productivity gains across most categories of our DOE. The exception remained vehicle damage costs, particularly those on our EVs, which we are addressing in a very targeted way. Excluding net collision and damage costs in both periods, DOE per transaction day was down 10% year-over-year, which is consistent with our goals coming into 2023 and reflects our continued focus on our global expense base. We are beginning to benefit from our significant investment in field technology and resulting productivity, including digital check-in, telematics and vehicle inventory tools and from our work to contain SG&A.We remain confident in our trajectory. We have made considerable progress in the improvement of our technology, migration of systems to the cloud, investment in talent and better control of how we operate our fleet, in addition to improving our customer offering. Nevertheless, we underperformed in Q3 relative to our expectations and must correct the issues that weighed on our results. To better understand these factors and provide additional context on the quarter, I want to talk briefly about each of our premium Hertz brand, our value brands and our rideshare and electric vehicle strategies.Let me begin with Hertz. This was a bright spot in the quarter. As you know, we have been working hard to increase brand loyalty and recurring business for our premium Hertz brand. We are driving initiatives to improve the customer experience from the shop and book aspects of our digital assets through rental delivery, in addition to building financially attractive partnerships across the travel industry. We are confident that theseREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

This is the product of a very purposeful strategy to identify specific markets by brand, customer type and even car class, where we see the opportunity to realize better pricing. We also continued in Q3 to grow our corporate and insurance replacement business revenues under the Hertz brand. As I noted, rates for these customer channels are knowingly dilutive to headline RPD. However, given better intra-week utilization for corporate and longer length of keep on insurance replacement and therefore, lower cost, they are each important to our total business mix.Turning next to our value brands, Dollar and Thrifty. Here results validate our strategy. While we have enjoyed a pricing premium to several key competitors in the Hertz leisure channel, we've continued to see a relative discount in our value brands. Our strategy to reinvigorate Dollar Thrifty aims to fix this. We are aggressively at work to deliver the service sought by value-oriented customers to help us close the gap. Enhancements to our customer experience expected to develop throughout 2024 across our system, including improved shop and book on digital channels, advanced check-in, digital offering of value-added services and assign cars with field agents ready to facilitate upgrades.These products were not sufficiently in evidence during the summer to yield the unit revenue results that we saw at Hertz. As our sequential rate increase for Dollar was up only 3%. We believe as our initiatives mature, Dollar and Thrifty will be better positioned to move closer to pricing parity with more established value brands in the market. We also expect margins for this channel to improve on the back of lower cost of rental delivery and less expensive vehicles. Finally, it is worth pointing out that improvement to the customer experience which enables us to take rate up even absent share gain will alone improve financial performance.Let me now turn to our rideshare business and EV strategy, which are complementary. Our rideshare business is growing with year-over-year volume up 50%. The business is positioned well for further expansion as new markets open including cities that are working to mandate the deployment of EVs in urban mobility and those like New York City, which just recently announced that it is making more licenses specifically available to EVs for rideshare use. Hertz is proving to be an affordable entry point for drivers and an available source of electric vehicles as mobility companies and their drivers adopt electrification. Rising fuel prices and attractive revenue incentives from shared mobility companies are creating opportunity for us in a customer channel where we continue to build a best-in-class offering.Our recent progress is reassuring as earlier in 2023 and occasioned by higher incidents of damage among EV rideshare drivers, we took steps to moderate our rideshare growth and re-underwrite the rideshare driver base. This meant purposefully slowing the supply of EVs into rideshare and moving more electric vehicles into the leisure channel to facilitate their ongoing utilization. With hindsight, this left leisure over fleeted with EVs. As a result, RPD for our electric vehicles in leisure dropped, which contributed to the lower RPD performance for the company in the quarter. As you would expect, we have been parsing the data on damage and actively remediating the causals.Entering Q4, we are more confident in the quality of demand in rideshare, buffeted by enhanced processes to better underwrite drivers and to improve the mix of more experienced higher length of keep drivers. This is enabling us to return confidently to a strategy of growing the level of our existing electric fleet that is allocated to this business. Over the next several quarters, we expect to move an increasing number of our current electric vehicles into the rideshare fleet, supplementing the several thousand EV on rents made in just the last several months.As we pull these cars from leisure, we are simultaneously tightening the EV supply in that channel and more accurately matching the fleet to demand in effect seeking to reverse the issue that pressured the quarter and adhering to our ROA mentality. We're also continuing to take steps to rectify the issue of elevated EV damage costs broadly, which we had thought would come down more quickly than they have.Let me share a bit more context on the damage equation. First, while conventional maintenance on electric vehicles remained lower relative to comparable ICE vehicles in Q3, higher collision and damage repairs on EVs continue to weigh on our results and negatively impacted EBITDA. For context, collision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

The MSRP declines in EVs over the course of 2023, driven primarily by Tesla have driven the fair market value of our EVs lower as compared to last year, such that a salvage creates a larger loss and, therefore, greater burden.By contrast, market values in portions of our fleet last year exceeded carrying values, resulting in some salvages producing gains. While this had a negative effect in Q3, it is, of course, a VIN-specific phenomenon and should therefore not be thought of as a permanent effect on results. Given these headwinds, we are actioning collision and damage with urgency with particular focus on the aspects we can more readily impact, like incidence, parts procurement and reimbursement.We have activated a comprehensive end-to-end damage program from underwriting to collections. We're also developing additional easy-to-use educational tools on EV functionality but perhaps most importantly, we are working with the relevant OEMs to improve outcomes based on vehicle performance.Let me try to put some dimension to the issue. Taking account of the impact on depreciation, collision and damage and RPU relating to our EV fleet, we estimate that had our fleet in Q3 been similarly sized but comprised solely of ICE vehicles our EBITDA margin would have been several margin points higher. This frames our challenge in as much as it reflects on the stability of our underlying business. To that end, we are pulling all controllable levers to bring the incremental cost down. We nonetheless remain committed to our long-term strategy to electrify the fleet. We believe in the value of being a first-mover.Electric vehicles open the door to our growing presence in rideshare, where electrification is a fast approaching requirement, not merely an option in a channel where we are uniquely positioned. We benefit from our access to partnerships with other players around electrification who are open to an early mover, including those with interest in charging, electric fleet management and autonomous vehicles.There's also the case of corporate and government demand, which is manifesting quickly as these customers seek to satisfy their own sustainability objectives. Early engagement here is sticky. And as EV ownership grows, we expect rental demand to grow in tandem. By gaining early competitive knowledge on how to manage a profitable EV rental fleet, we believe we are gaining value and positioning Hertz to ramp efficiently and confidently. And finally, the capabilities to manage an EV fleet are not learned overnight and are differentiating. The cadence of repair and maintenance is different as is charging, demand generation, rental fulfillment and fleet management.Make no mistake, we are developing a clear understanding of the key levers needed to deliver a more profitable EV rental fleet in a world that is moving toward electrification. Transitions of this magnitude are not easy, and there are important factors, including charging infrastructure, the pace of OEM production and the growth of the EV aftermarket that we simply cannot control.Nonetheless, there's an undeniable transformation underway. The share of new electric vehicle sales in the U.S. is growing and studies of current EV ownership evidence lower incidence of damage and collision than for ICE vehicles, not higher as we are experiencing. We believe these trends will converge.In sum, our objective is straightforward. We want to offer our customers the widest possible choice of vehicle makes and models, whether gas-powered or electric so that they can travel the way that best suits their needs and preferences. We know the challenges at hand and are working to remedy that, which we can. And will pace ourselves accordingly with an expectation that our in-fleeting of EVs will be slower than our prior expectations, but we will be stronger for having begun the journey when we did.Looking past our results in Q3, I want to close my remarks with a few comments about our expectations on the forward. 2023 has become a transitional year for the company, where we continue to fix and improve the foundational elements of the business from basic technology and field capability through to product offerings and brand strengthening.In 2024, we will focus on continuing to execute on our revenue and cost initiatives with an expectation that they will contribute to our financial performance throughout the year and into 2025 as they begin to mature. As I have noted before and as we present on Page 10 of our accompanying material, the initiatives and focus include both operational projects as well as newer business lines, namely harvesting our meaningful investmentREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

Continuing to elevate our operational efficiency on a global basis through improved productivity and fixed cost leverage, including Europe, where we continue to rationalize our footprint.Expanding on our vehicle sales results through improved retail operations and our partnership with Carvana and other similar outlets. Learning from our initial engagements with EVs to reduce expenses and improve the margin profile across the whole of the business. Improving the competitiveness of our value brands, Dollar and Thrifty, to enable our business to close the pricing gap to our more established competitors. And finally, growing our rideshare business.Taken together, these initiatives represent an opportunity to materially enhance our financial performance and add in the range of $500 million in incremental EBITDA at maturity. We also believe these initiatives will render the business more durable to withstand macro pressures. In all, we are setting a course for the company to improve with a new COO set to take his seat, we look forward to the opportunity to host an Investor Day in the quarters ahead to provide greater detail around our initiatives and their expected financial contribution. I continue to believe that the business opportunity ahead of us is significant and achievable. Of course, in the end, we will be measured on the delivery of these initiatives and not their mere mention. That said, the work has begun and much of the capital has been invested. It is on us to execute.Let me now turn to Alex for more detail on our quarterly results.Alexandra Dawn Brooks - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - Executive VP & CFOThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. As we've noted, revenue of $2.7 billion demonstrated growth of 8% versus 1 year ago and 11% sequentially. To give you color on the segments, this reflected year-over-year increases of 6% in the Americas segment and 17% in our International segment.Volume was up substantially year-over-year in both segments as well as sequentially. Pricing also grew sequentially, up 2% in the Americas and 3% in international. Although down year-over-year, 8% in Americas and 6% in International as compared to exceptionally strong rates in Q3 2022. Our average global fleet size was 590,000 vehicles and utilization of our fleet remained high at 83%, contributing to global monthly revenue per unit for the quarter of $1,596 up 5% sequentially.Q3 utilization in the Americas was 84%, up 320 basis points year-over-year and up 160 basis points sequentially. International utilization in Q3 was 80%, up 330 basis points year-over-year and 180 basis points sequentially, reflecting continued strength in demand. Strong utilization resulted in healthy RPU of $1,636 in the Americas and $1,440 in international. Net depreciation per unit in Q3 was $282 per month within the range guided on our last call.As Stephen noted, adjusted corporate EBITDA was $359 million in Q3, a margin of 13%. I would note that SG&A at $209 million for the quarter is within the outlook provided on our last call. As noted earlier, DOE per transaction day continued to reflect elevated collision and damage, mitigated by various cost discipline and productivity initiatives. As we noted, excluding net collision and damage costs in both periods, DOE per transaction day decreased by approximately 10% year-over-year for Q3, largely driven by our efforts to improve field personnel productivity and reduce fleet-related costs like maintenance, transportation, fuel and facilities.Turning to our capital structure and liquidity. With respect to our balance sheet, net corporate debt at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion. Net corporate leverage for Q3 was 1.9x, modestly above our target of 1.5x. At September 30th, our available liquidity was $1.7 billion, which includes approximately $600 million of unrestricted cash. During the quarter, we issued $1 billion of fixed rate rental car asset-backed notes under the U.S. ABS facility with a combined average interest rate of approximately 6.5%. $500 million of these notes mature in 2027 and $500 million mature in 2029. We also extended the maturity on the European ABS to March 2026, along with an upsize of EUR 100 million. The blended rate in our U.S. ABS facility remains at approximately 4% and carries rate caps as required under the facility. At September 30, we had capacity under our ABS of $2.1 billion globally, and our vehicle debt portfolio was approximately 70% fixed rate, which serves to mitigate the impact of a rising rate environment. We also maintained sufficient equity cushion in our ABS at quarter end.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Overall, we continue to maintain a well-structured debt maturity ladder with no material corporate debt maturities until 2026.Turning to our cash flow and capital allocation. For the third quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $313 million. Adjusted operating cash flow was $215 million, with fleet CapEx as an inflow of $124 million on the back of the start of our seasonal de-fleeting. Non-fleet CapEx came in at $26 million. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of our common stock, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $250 million. Finally, let me give some color around our forward-looking expectations.Looking to Q4, we anticipate our revenue to move in line with historical seasonality as reflected in both RPD and transaction days. We expect depreciation to key off the market and to fall within a range of $280 to $300 per unit with variability to be occasioned by volatility in residual values, which could alter gross and net depreciation and which may cause us to adjust our fleet plans accordingly through the end of the year.In closing, let me reiterate the strength of our core RAC business, especially as it relates to the premium Hertz brand. We believe there is substantial upside opportunity to grow margins and cash flows as we work through the EV headwinds, reach the end of our elevated technology expenditure and continue to optimize our value brands and European operations. We continue to expect our growth initiatives to meaningfully contribute to both the top and bottom lines.With that, let's open the call for Q&A.Q U E S T I O N S A N D A N S W E R SOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.Chris Jon Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research AnalystStephen, I think you said that your margin for the quarter was around 13%, but if you normalize your business for all the ICE vehicles, it would have been, I guess, several basis points -- several hundred basis points higher. So I guess the question is, I would assume that you would kind of only buy EVs if you thought it would be accretive to margin, right? But you're suggesting that the economics of the EVs will improve over time. But I mean how do you get there? I mean are there -- what composition of EVs do you need to make that margin comment come true? And I guess, just why are the economics of the EV is improving over time?Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanSure. Thanks for the question, Chris. You're right. Our reported margin was 13%. And as I referenced, if you sort of put boundary around the cost challenges associated with EVs, it would have been several points higher, several hundred basis points higher. I would say on the EVs and margin, remember, none of this escapes sort of the regimen of subjecting any asset to an ROA analysis and ensuring that the forward returns are positive in any asset that we bring in.And equally recall that when we first underwrote the margin potential around EVs, these were priced materially higher than where we are right now. And so on the standing fleet, there was very adequate margin to be embedded. What has eroded that margin on the current portfolio are basically 3 things. One is depreciation, which was occasioned by about a drop of 1/3 in the MSRP of these cars. Obviously, that lowered the residual and elevated depreciation. The second is around damage and salvage. This is a solvable issue and one that we are working on right now. It's both a question of incidence of damage and cost.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

So we're looking for more experienced drivers, longer length of keep, where the incidence of damage goes down. And then equally, on cost, as I mentioned, right now, EVs are costing us about twice in terms of damage cost repair than a conventional ICE vehicle.Two things are going to happen here. One, our assumption is that the market is going to come our way, meaning the proliferation of aftermarket, the proliferation of parts supply is going to grow and come down in price. But we're not simply waiting for that to happen. We ourselves are negotiating around parts procurement at steeper discounts, doing damage repair ourselves and bringing these expenses down. So damage and salvage is going to come down, both by actions we are taking currently in addition to where the market is moving.The third piece, so the first being depreciation, the second being damaged and salvage, the third being RPU, that is what are we generating by way of revenue per unit on these cars. And as I said in the -- in my prepared remarks, we went through a re-underwrite to our rideshare business, and moved cars into leisure. We're now quite confident to move them back that's going to have 2 effects. One, it's going to feed a higher RPU in natural demand that's being expressed among Uber and Lyft drivers. And equally, it's going to tighten supply relative to natural demand that exists in leisure, and we will see the premium pricing come back up. Of course, all of those observations relate to the remediation of margin on the current portfolio.I think the second way to answer your question is on the forward. New buys here are going to come at lower prices. We are better buyers at lower prices. Now we'll pace ourselves to ensure both that the problems that are in front of us are solved and being solved and equally watch what demand looks like. But I can tell you, we remain committed, as I said, to being a first-mover, it's important to us. But now buying these cars, $25,000 or $35,000 or in that range, obviously make margins work and equally will only improve as and to the extent that we resolve the damage and salvage and the RPU component, recognizing depreciation on the extended fleet or the existing fleet will remain fixed.And I think there, the notion of being a first mover, as I said, is as compelling to us now as it was before. There are learnings that are here and we know how to fix some of these cost initiatives.The last thing I'll say, just closing out on your question is that I think the one thing to take note of when you put a boundary around the EV cost issue and you look at margin being several points or several hundred basis points higher, is that it does speak to the inherent strength of the core ICE business and that's reflective of pricing strategies we've taken around Hertz and strategy we're developing around our value brands Dollar and Thrifty. And equally, I think it reflects the baseline demand of a relatively strong market that still is seeing need for our product.Chris Jon Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research AnalystSuper, super helpful. So as a follow-up and realizing this is probably an imperfect question and a little bit theoretical. As we look to next year, because you've talked about a lot of initiatives and a lot of things that went sideways this year that you're working on, I mean, I guess if we took some of the macro out of it and just said, hey, you're going to have flat volume and flat RPD.What -- Is there a level of offset you can quantify in terms of -- what would it take to get EBITDA growth next year if you had a very small range of top line outcomes. Again, not necessarily a super realistic question, but I'm trying to get a sense for what can actually -- how much do some of these things that impacted you in '23 and some of the initiatives you're still rolling out? Can that -- what does that add up to potentially in '24?Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanSure. Well, I don't think it's a theoretical question. I mean it's a question that sits right in front of us, and we are minded to execute to it. And I would say it's both on the revenue and the expense side. On the revenue side, we're not waiting to start on the build of the Dollar brand, and we're not waiting to continue to build and improve and benefit from strong growth in our rideshare business.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

In other words, assumed Dollar is not a share grab, just take it as relatively flat volume. The ability to take price up by offering out a better product such that we see people in greater strength coming to us. The ability to exercise price leverage on the back of a better product on a static book of demand is financially accretive to us.On the rideshare side, we continue to see extraordinary growth, 50% growth year over year. And I think this is only going to continue to grow because with time, we move closer to deadlines in certain cities where, in fact, this is going to become a requirement.On the cost side, again, let's not let EV mask progress being made on DOE. DOE was down 10% on a per day basis, per transaction day basis year-over-year. That's not the end of the work that's going on.And our new COO is going to come in and take this on full bore as we continue to drive meaningful cost reduction out of the business because technology will improve our ability to operate with efficiency. And equally, we're going to look for efficiency in the context of taking costs down that relates to this EV issue around damage and collision, and the like.And so again, your question is not theoretical. It's a work task that's right in front of us now that we're working on. And again, against a flat market, as you characterize, there are opportunities to take revenue up and there are opportunities to take expense down. And on the revenue side, it's not entirely reliant on growth in days, it's leveraging price based on a better product.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Ian Zaffino with Oppenheimer.Ian Alton Zaffino - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystI just wanted to follow up maybe on that previous question and then really a main question was on the previous question. Can you maybe talk about how much of the dilution or whatever you want to call it, from EVs is specifically, I guess, related to Tesla versus non-Tesla. So if you normalize and as the fleet kind of normalizes throughout various EVs, will you just naturally get a margin uplift from that diversification?And then, maybe I guess the main question was on the pricing side, I guess we're not pricing, I think you said market shares were relatively stable. Can you maybe just talk about the environment, kind of the willingness of competitors to follow your lead when you try to take up price and what they're kind of generally thinking overall?Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanSure. Yes, sure. So first, on the EV question, recognize that the total EV fleet is about 11% of the total fleet, and Teslas represent about 80% of that. And so there's quite a bit of the cost element that relates to the Teslas as opposed to others. And so our focus and our work with Tesla is to look at the performance of the car, so as to lower the risk of incidence of damage and we're in very direct engagement with them on parts procurement and labor and the like. So that's working. I would say that over time, to the extent we take on more GM electric vehicles, as an example, again, we'll be buying all of the forward EVs at an appreciably lower price point than where we bought the 80% of our fleet, which is Tesla. So that's obviously a benefit.And I think that there are elements of those cars that will likely speak to lower incidence of damage. But I think perhaps more importantly, you will speak to a lower cost of parts and labor. Remember, in the likes of GM and other OEMs, there's decades of establishment of a broad national parts supply network. There's an aftermarket of parts that is there, that is less mature, obviously, in the context of Tesla. And so I suspect as implied by your question, that margins will improve and this issue will improve as we look to diversify.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

So I think there's a natural progression of cost reduction, but I think there's work in front of us. We understand what it is, and we're doing it to fix it.On the second part of your question around pricing. Look, we're dramatically changing the way in which Hertz as a brand behaves. I mean for many, many years, Hertz was known as a brand that sort of played to the low end of price, meaning we played higher to volume, drove price down to find that volume and produce revenue on that basis. It is undeniably the inverse now. We have taken brands and disassembled them. We look at markets, we look at cars, we look at customer sets and we broke down, for example, Hertz into deciles. We clip the lower decile not willing to sort of rent at that particular price. And then we look to find markets, as I said in my prepared remarks, that demonstrate price inelasticity.And as I said, I think it was at the JPMorgan conference quite publicly in the summer, we were at that point, orchestrating a price increase on Hertz. And we were able to do that in a way where we saw very little in the way of degradation of volume but bringing price up. And remember, price runs about 80% to the EBITDA line. So you're more than willing to sort of sacrifice volume where you can take price up, not to the extreme, but within the boundaries of reason, and we did that.And we did see some followship, and we continue to show price leadership in and throughout markets where we can make that trade, and we will make that trade all day. The circumstance in Dollar, as I mentioned, is a different one. We're reinvigorating that brand and we're doing that for a reason. We're doing it because a better product will give us greater pricing leverage. And our hope and expectation is that we're on a journey to get to better pricing parity to our competitors, and we will get there.These are people that rent once or twice in an 18-month period. They are skewed heavily toward price but not if the experience is going to be at a meaningful discount. And so bringing that experience up will give us pricing pressure. And again, as I said, the whole notion around Dollar doesn't depend on share and gaining days. It depends on taking a static number of days and bringing price up, and we're quite confident in our ability to do that.Ian Alton Zaffino - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. If I could just squeeze in one quick one for Alex. Can you maybe just talk about some of the productivity initiatives you guys have in place now? And kind of what are the benefits you've attained so far?Alexandra Dawn Brooks - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - Executive VP & CFOSure, Ian, thanks for the question. When you look at DOE per transaction day, the headwinds on collision and damages are masking the underlying progress we've been making on our core cost initiatives. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've achieved over $100 million of DOE savings on a year-over-year basis through these productivity improvements. About half of that is related to labor productivity, particularly in the field and about half is in our fleet-related cost savings like maintenance, fuel and transportation costs.So double-clicking into that, on field labor productivity, we reduced our own staffing over time, and we've also cut back on our third-party labor. And on the theme of third-party labor, we've also reduced it as it relates to our maintenance and vehicle documentation. So by bringing more of this work in-house, we're better able to control our own costs and achieve our productivity objectives.On fuel, we're using enhanced telematics to improve our accuracy. And on transportation costs, we've employed advanced fleet management tools to streamline our fleet movements and reduce our transportation costs. So we're encouraged by our progress so far, but there's more work to do here, as Stephen mentioned. And we're looking forward to Justin Keppy joining the team as our new COO and driving these initiatives even further.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

John, please make sure that your line is unmuted.Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.Hans Peter Hoffman - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity AssociateThis is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. I was just curious, did moving more Teslas into your leisure segment, give you any sort of RPD bump in the quarter? And if so, could you maybe quantify that? And I was also just kind of curious I guess do you think that over time that Teslas can kind of maintain their RPD premium kind of given these sort of discounts or if there's maybe some sort of novelty factor that's kind of playing into the RPD premium there?Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanThanks for the question. So on the electric vehicles in leisure, I think on the forward, our view is that we need to bring supply in line with natural demand that's being expressed. And as we've always said, we want to bring our fleet inside the demand curve. That same holds true in terms of electric vehicles in leisure. And there are a number of sort of parts to the demand equation on the RAC side. Leisure, of course, being one where people have a natural desire and interest in driving an EV.Equally, our fleet becomes a very interesting proposition around test drive for a lot of these cars for people who are being introduced to this. But equally, we see opportunity for EV deployment in RAC around insurance replacement, around corporate and government, all under the Hertz brand and in those cases, these are Tesla drivers who have an insurance replacement and will want to take on another EV as part of that insurance replacement product.And we see growth in corporate and in government where in both instances, there's a desire to pick up on sustainability objectives that they have. And so there are a number of pockets of demand that will drive in the RAC side and we need to maintain the supply that's inside that to attain kind of premium RPU.I would say equally and maybe more impactfully, the electric vehicle in our rideshare business as an interesting and different and very strong level of demand. Again, that demand is on the part of the driver who wants entry into an electric vehicle because the net economics to that driver, both by virtue of renting a car from Hertz around fuel and around incentives that are given to them by the rideshare or mobility companies yields a better economic outcome from them or for them.And to the extent that these cars are still expensive, new, and there's been no real used market that to come about. We become a natural and most economic entry point for those drivers to come in and the benefit is proving out. And so we're seeing meaningful growth in demand in the rideshare side, and we're equally seeing longer length of keep, and we've been designing incentives and programs and pricing schemes in tandem with Uber to sort of feed that. That is get more experienced drivers in with longer length of keep, that obviously drives down damage costs, but equally, it drives down cost overall because remember, length of keep in that business is key to bringing the ultimate cost down and the margin of that rental high.Hans Peter Hoffman - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity AssociateThat's helpful. And I guess I just kind of wanted to touch on capital allocation decisions a bit. I think you guys have close to 1 billion sort of left in your buyback authorization. Just curious how you guys were thinking about buyback in Q4 and then into 2024 as well. Just kind of curious if higher fleet funding costs and then potentially lower residuals could be somewhat like a limiting factor here.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanWell, look, I would say that there's no departure from what we have said repeatedly in terms of priority, which is to invest in fleet and non-fleet in terms of building the business and then looking at buyback as an opportunity, it's obviously an attractive opportunity given where the stock price has moved, but we take all 3 of those in tandem and make a decision on rational deployment of capital against both the near-term and short-term value of that investment.OperatorOur next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John, please make sure your line is not muted.Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.Ryan Joseph Brinkman - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research AnalystI thought to ask on EVs also. I appreciate the comments about EBITDA margin in the quarter pro forma for a purely ICE versus blended portfolio. Have you maybe kept like a running tally of all of the tailwinds to EBITDA since the start-up Hertz' EV strategy in the fall of 2021, such as higher revenue per day, which maybe didn't manifest itself as much this quarter, lower routine maintenance costs and possibly even higher transaction days, although I'm not sure how you can measure that with certainty.But then also the tailwinds to EBITDA like the higher collision damage repair cost that you cited in 3Q. But then also, of course, the higher depreciation resulting from the Tesla and other EV automaker price cuts impacting residuals. Do you have that net number? And then is there like a targeted date by which EV portfolio that transition might turning into a positive EBITDA contributor relative to the ICE portfolio when it would have similar or higher margins, et cetera?Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanWell, let me start off by saying it is a positive contributor to EBITDA. It's just proving to be not as positive given some of these near-term cost challenges that we both understand and are addressing straight up. And so it's important to sort of understand it that way. I think the way I would try to answer your question is that revenue production as a function of both price stability and demand for product, I think, is clear. And that's being driven across the whole of our fleet. And remember, we're offering electric vehicles out to our customers because they want them, meaning we're offering the widest mix of vehicles to meet the needs and desires of our customer set.I'd also say that the offering of EVs as a product is an entry point into a rideshare business that would exist purely with ICE. So don't misunderstand me, but I think is accelerated by virtue of the offer of electric vehicles, and they are growing quite considerably inside the fleet by an order of about 50% in growth in EV utilization in rideshare.And I think in response to the last question, it's clear that there are better economics that get even better just given where fuel costs and other costs sort of go for ultimate drivers. So part of what you see in the revenue is a tailwind. It is a benefit of the offering of the EV product and so there is a contribution to EBITDA that's being made. The reason to call out the several points of margin degradation occasion by this is to really dimensionalize the effect of this, it is not a pervasive issue.Baseline costs in terms of DOE, as Alex noted, came down 10% year-over-year. And so our ability to address and fix the cost equation where I think the revenue equation is more in focus in terms of how to deploy the EVs. I think you'll start to see this reflect better in ultimate EBITDA production around the EV but equally across the whole of the fleet. If that answers the question you were putting to us.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And just maybe as a follow-up to it. Beyond addressing the repair cost issue, are there other changes you might be contemplating with regard to the EV strategy such as maybe pivoting away from earlier EV as a percent of fleet targets. Over the last week, GM, for example, has pulled away from some of its EV sales and capacity expansion targets in light of changing demand in order to shore it up or be able to reiterate per unit EV profitability target.I heard you say you're now a buyer at lower prices of the Tesla vehicles. But how are you thinking about -- and like things are changing, like Elon Musk comment on some of the recent Tesla earnings calls this year where he spoken about being willing to potentially continue to lower prices on new vehicles all the way you said down to where they would make a 0% margin at the time of new vehicle sale because he's hoping to make it up on the back end by monetizing a larger installed base to sell aftermarket RoboTaxi software and other services into. So just curious how that might enter into your calculus if you're still comfortable buying Teslas even at lower prices, given that automakers mindset with regard to new vehicle pricing strategy going forward.Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanWell, let me just say at the start. There's no world in which we're going to buy Teslas to achieve a 0 EBITDA margin. So that may be a strategy among a select number of OEMs, but it's not ours. We're going to hold every purchase to an ROA threshold where we're quite confident that the EBITDA margin to be generated on that car will be positive and will be attractive.So let me just be very clear about that. The comment that I made about being a better buyer for those cars that meet that threshold, we are, by definition, a better buyer at lower prices than to be a better buyer at higher prices. So price decline will benefit us in the context of forward purchases. I think it's also important to say that I'm not out to achieve a fixed percentage of our fleet being electric by date and time, meaning much as we had initially targeted to get to 25% of our fleet being electric by the end of 2024.I've said this before, and I'll just repeat it here, that's not hard in stone, meaning we're going to continue to grow our fleet. We believe in the first-mover advantage. We're going to hold ourselves out to a very hard screen on EBITDA margin and return. And so we're not a buyer for the sake of being a buyer. But we will continue to grow. I mean, as I said, the first-mover edge here, I believe, is real. And I think there's no technology change that has happened in the world that operates on a straight line without some sort of challenges that are presented.But I think in the end, it's our ticket to rideshare, it's our access to partners. We're feeding demand that's growing among corporate and government. We're seeing rental increase commensurate with ownership. And importantly, we're getting an early jump on a set of learn skills that I don't think are easy to learn or gain overnight. And I would tell you that when you look at those rationale, when you look at that rationale as to why we want to be a first-mover, I would say that your engagement with a customer who wants to rent an EV from you starts to get sticky because the rhythm is established.They understand how to do it, where to do, how your apps work, where they're charging. The engagement with corporates, with whom we have contracts and in conversations we've had with government would suggest that, that too poses a very sticky engagement around this model of car, and we're going to pursue it. The engagement around rideshare involves a whole sort of exercise of engagement with Uber around programs and pricing schemes and technology engagement, all of that is not rippable quickly in the context of what's there. And it's a less competitive market relative to sort of the dynamic price movements you see in RAC.I'd also point out that the technology engagement that we have with Tesla was cited in the Tesla earning call in the context of us creating unique apps for our customers that enable them to use the car with greater ease than not. All of these are aspects that I think will ultimately prove to be through our great benefit in terms of the value, and we have a plan to sort of address the near-term costs that have produced that delta in margin.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG.REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv.

If we could talk a little bit about the Dollar and Thrifty efforts here. Could you provide a little bit more detail on this initiative, some of the tactics and time line, I'm guessing some of -- a lot of this will be addressed at your Investor Day, but any more detail here, tactics and time line would be helpful.Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanYes, absolutely. So just for context, Dollar and Thrifty were brands that were bought by Hertz about it, I think, more than a decade ago. And I think that they were not particularly well attended relative to sort of where our competition moved with value brand. And the TAM here is significant. And I think that part of the challenge that we have, and it proved out in the third quarter is that the journey for a customer around our value brand is not yet to the specification that it ought to be.And as a consequence, we're compelled to price lower than where other value brands price.So somebody, for example, that cares to use an OTA as opposed to coming to us directly. We'll see a score around the Dollar or Thrifty brand that is appreciably lower than the competition. And they then make a judgment about how much lower will they need to procure a car to justify that experience. We don't want that to happen anymore. So we're improving the journey in order to regain pricing leverage and ultimate pricing parity.So what are we doing? First of all, the shop and book is better. We have engaged with third parties in the build of a different shop and book proposition. That will yield outcomes where we will communicate much like the airlines do with somebody that's going to rent a car from Dollar in advance, where we'll offer value-added service products, upgrades and the like, again, much like the airlines do. Then you will arrive at the airport with an assigned space where your car will be, there will be people with tablets who are going to sort of show you to an upgraded car should you want it, offer you other services to the extent you want it, you'll be given a QR code, you then move to the exit gate and off you go and we will have captured on the shop and book, driver's license and various other things.That is a much better process than one that involves long wait times online. Now this is not a hypothetical. This is already happening at 4 airports. So this is a project that has begun already. We're going to look to expand it to 10 then 20, then to the top 30 airports and expand this as and when we test it, validate it, hone any issues that need to be honed and get this out. And again, this is not a share grab much as I'd like to take share. This is a question of can we take price even against the static book of business, which will be meaningfully accretive to us in the context of lower cost, lower depreciated cars, better margin and better pricing.Christopher Nicholas Stathoulopoulos - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - AssociateOkay. And then on the demand side, I know that you said fourth quarter is -- it sounds like at least seasonally in line, but we've had some results from several of the airlines today. Some worse than others. It would suggest that leisure demand here in the U.S. is softening. So could you perhaps provide a little bit more detail as it relates to these -- however buckets you see it as it relates to the leisure business and then inbound international.Stephen M. Scherr - Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. - CEO & ChairmanYes. I mean I think that as I read the airlines, and I listened to the commentary there's a bit of a dichotomy that's breaking between kind of upper end travel, which I would include certain corporate travel and more leisure or value travel. And obviously, the airlines SKU differently as to which component of that they emphasize. I would say in our Hertz brand, which plays to a more premium product, both by way of service offering, loyalty and the like. We continue to see strength in leisure, both in North America and in Europe.Now it's obviously hard to have conviction as to what's to happen to the consumer and what's to happen to the economy as we get deeper into the fourth quarter or into next year. And obviously, we have a slightly more limited forward booking view then do airlines or hotels. But in theREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us©2023 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

We're going to do all that we can do to sort of capture as much pricing as we can around that brand.Obviously, the Dollar value brand is being built, as I've now described several times in response to questions could that get softer? It could, but I think the countervailing view on it is that as we improve, we'll gain some pricing pressure, and we're not looking to that in the earliest sort of phase of that model to see a meaningful pickup in days. We're just looking for pricing leverage around it. So that's how I would sort of parse through this.OperatorThis concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call over to Stephen Scherr, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.Stephen M.

Guideline for BPPM 60.50The information contained in this guideline is the processes typically recommended by Human Resource Services (HRS). Neither these guidelines nor any University policies, procedures, or practices shall be construed as an express or implied contract of employment or a promise of continued employment.  None of these guidelines are intended, by reason of their publication, to confer any rights or privileges upon you or to entitle you to be or to remain employed.  The information appearing in these guidelines in not binding on WSU and is subject to change at the discretion of WSU.The guideline contains a compilation of current practices relating to how to proceed, these may evolve over time as the institution and its internal and external environments change.  For these reasons, the University reserves the right to revise these guidelines or any of its polices or benefits or to institute new guidelines, policies and benefits provided these changes are not inconsistent with state and federal law, or to act apart from these guidelines at any time.  Any such modification applies upon adoption by the University, regardless of previous provisions that may have been in effect.  The most current version of this guideline is available on the HRS web site.The laws of the state of Washington and appropriate Washington Administrative Code provisions also apply to all employees, as does the University’s Business Policies and Procedures Manual.  All University guidelines and policies are subject to federal and state laws, as now existing or as hereafter amended; where there is deemed to be a conflict, the provisions of law apply.Civil Service StaffCorrective and Disciplinary Action Guidelines For appropriate procedures for Bargaining Unit Covered Staff refer to the appropriate contract Corrective/Disciplinary ActionQuestions for Managers to consider:What is the misconduct, which provides a reason for disciplinary action?Does the employee have a current and accurate position description and goals/expectations?What are the impacts of the employee’s misconduct on the organization?  How serious are the charges against the employee?Was the employee aware of accepted standards of conduct?  Was the employee ever put on notice that this behavior was unacceptable? How?  Note: if the behavior is of a type that is a well known standard in society, it may not be necessary to specifically spell it out. For example: it is not necessary to tell an employee not to steal money from co-workers.Has the employee received supervisory feedback on his/her performance?  When?  How?Has management provided the employee training and resources sufficient to allow acceptable job performance?  When?  How?If inadequate work performance, has the employee been provided sufficient opportunity and time to improve his/her performance? When?  How?Does the employee have a previous history of corrective or disciplinary action?  What?  How long ago?  Is the performance problem a reoccurrence or a pattern?Has the employee been counseled or reprimanded orally or in writing for the same conduct that is the basis for formal discipline?What documentation is available to support the action?  What is the quality of the documentation?Have you considered what may happen if the action is appealed?Have there been any technical violations of agency procedure or collective bargaining agreements related to documents and actions leading to this disciplinary action?What cause of action is supported in this disciplinary action?What has been past agency practice regarding situations and employees of similar circumstances?Are the rules for the employee’s category being followed?  Have you contacted your Human Resource Services office for guidance?Does the employee have a known disability, which impacts the performance or misconduct?What is the employee’s case or potential argument?  Are there mitigating circumstances?  For example: inconsistent supervisory directives, working employee out of class, and inadequate information.CORRECTIVE ACTIONWhat is Corrective Action?Corrective Action is a preventative measure taken to promote compliance with established University rules and/or expectations or general workplace standards in an effort to improve or modify unacceptable behavior or performance.  Corrective Action is intended to obtain compliance with established rules of conduct and performance, not merely to punish.  While the steps taken are typically progressive in nature, the University is not precluded from responding as appropriate to the incident under consideration.  Examples of Corrective Action:VerbalCounselingWarningReprimandWritten Notice of CounselingPerformance Improvement PlanLetter of ReprimandVerbal Counseling/Warning/Reprimand The manager explains the nature of the performance deficiency, problem, inappropriate behavior or rule violation.NOTE: To avoid double discipline, the supervisor/lead should explain what the performance deficiency was and what is expected of the employee.  For example, if the employee is late for their shift.  Meet with employee and tell him/her “You were 15 minutes late for your shift.  You are expected to be to work at 8:00 a.m.” If the manager adds, “If you are late again I will discipline you” this can be considered a verbal reprimand and this incident may not be able to be used during pre-disciplinary process.  The manager should briefly document the corrective action meeting. For example, add a notation to calendar or log; meeting notes/summary.  Accurate, factual, and appropriate documentation is critical throughout the process.The manager should review the employee’s position description, goals/expectations and other job requirements with the individual to assure accuracy and understanding.Notice of Counseling - WrittenThe manager explains the nature of the performance deficiency, problem, inappropriate behavior or rule violation to the employee.The manager prepares a written Notice of Counseling summarizing the concerns prior to or after meeting with the employee.It is strongly recommended to contact Human Resource Services for assistance with written documentation.The Notice of Counseling can be copied to the HRS personnel file or kept at the department level. If the Notice of Counseling is put in personnel file the employee must be notified.  This is generally done by including the following information at the bottom of the letter: “cc: HRS official personnel file”It is generally recommended that the Notice of Counseling be included in the employee’s personnel file.The Notice of Counseling serves as documentation.Performance Improvement PlanThe manager develops a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) which outlines the steps the individual is to take to correct the problem and how the manager will evaluate the progress.The manager reviews the PIP with the employee.The manager follows up with employee on progress.The manager tracks and adds notes on progress or lack thereof.The PIP can be copied to HRS personnel file or kept at department level. If the PIP is put in the personnel file the employee must be notified. This is generally done by including the following information at the bottom of the PIP: “cc: HRS official personnel file”It is generally recommended that the Performance Improvement Plan be included in the employee’s personnel file.It is strongly recommended to contact Human Resource Services for assistance with written documentation.The PIP serves as documentation.Written Letter of ReprimandThe manager states in writing problem(s), rules or standards not met, time of previous discussions, conclusions and action expected in future. Include a statement that if conduct is repeated or progress not made, disciplinary action may occur.The reprimand may be copied to HRS personnel file, and the employee should be notified of that fact.  This is generally done by including the following information at the bottom of the reprimand: “cc: HRS official personnel file”It is strongly recommended that the Letter of Reprimand be included in the employee’s personnel file.It is strongly recommended to contact Human Resource Services for assistance with written documentation.A written reprimand serves as documentation.Disciplinary Action For Civil Service employees, WSU follows the provisions of WAC 357-40.  Due to the highly regulated and structured process of discipline under the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), it is strongly recommended that HRS be contacted for assistance with implementing Disciplinary Action.What is Disciplinary Action?Disciplinary Action: Formal actions taken when either corrective measures fail to correct a previous problem or the seriousness of the offense warrants more formal measures.  Disciplinary Actions can only be imposed only by an appointing authority.  The Appointing Authority list can be found at Appointing Authority.  Examples of Disciplinary Actions:DemotionSuspension without payReduction in SalaryImmediate DismissalDismissalThe distinction between Corrective Action and Disciplinary Action: Corrective type actions are generally more informal, non-pay affecting preventative measures to encourage appropriate behavior/job performance.  Disciplinary actions are taken as a formal “discipline” step when more informal measures have not altered/eliminated inappropriate behavior/performance.  The steps taken are typically progressive in nature but, may be adjusted depending on the severity of the infraction.  Because of the serious nature and impact of disciplinary action, there are several additional considerations.  For example, performance or conduct, evaluations, years of service, and performance history may serve as mitigating factors.  It is in accordance with this concept that two employees who have committed identical forms of misconduct may receive different levels of discipline.  The level of discipline taken is generally determined by the employee’s overall employment history.DISCIPLINARY PROCESSProgressive Order of Discipline:As with corrective action, the concept of progressive discipline normally applies.  Except in extreme situations of misconduct or poor performance, initial disciplinary action should be at the “lower” end of the scale.  Repeated misconduct or poor performance should result in a more severe penalty.  Each action builds upon the other and will have a different impact on the employee.Listed below are brief descriptions of various disciplinary actions.   Note: The process for actions differs depending on the employee category.  Contact your respective Human Resource Services office for guidance before taking any action. Reminder: Refer to the appropriate Bargaining Unit Contract for Collective Bargaining Unit employees.Suspension Without Pay:A suspension removes the employee from the work site without pay for a specified period of time.  Suspensions can range between 1 – 15 days, with a 30 calendar day maximum within a calendar year, and are typically progressive. For example, depending on the severity of the conduct the first offense may be 2 days and the next offense 5 days.  When considering disciplinary action, determine which action is most appropriate.  For example, suspending an employee with an attendance problem may not be a good choice.  Reduction in Salary:A reduction in salary results in a reduction of an employee’s pay for a specified period of time.  Demotion:A demotion moves an employee from his/her position into a different position at a lesser salary range.  The demotion can be temporary or permanent. Demotion is generally used as a follow-up to previous disciplinary action or for an incident of serious misconduct.  Permanent Demotion may be an appropriate action to consider when, for example, it is apparent that an employee is incapable of adequately performing the duties and responsibilities of his/her position or when a person needs to be removed from supervisory responsibility.Dismissal/Immediate Dismissal: A dismissal separates the employee from employment.  Dismissal is the ultimate disciplinary action.  Dismissal generally is taken as a follow up to previous disciplinary action or for extreme acts of misconduct.The concept of progressive discipline is not always applicable.  Dismissal may be a suitable action in response to an isolated incident of egregious misconduct.Dismissal:An appointing authority may dismiss an employee with fifteen (15) calendar days’ written notice.Immediate Dismissal:An appointing authority may dismiss an employee effective immediately with pay in lieu of the fifteen (15) calendar days’ notice period.  As required by WAC 357-40-025 the appointing authority must still provide written notice of the specific charge(s) and the employee’s rights to appeal.An appointing authority may dismiss an employee effective immediately without pay in lieu of the fifteen (15) calendar days’ notice period if the appointing authority determines that continued employment of the employee jeopardizes the good of the service.  The appointing authority must provide written notice of the immediate dismissal stating the reason(s) for dismissal, the reasons immediate action is necessary, and the employee’s right to appeal.Which discipline is appropriate?In determining the appropriate level of disciplinary action to take, it is necessary to consider the impact that the action will have on the  employee.  Action taken should be one that provides the best opportunity for a positive impact on the employee’s performance and behavior and should be the lowest sanction that will correct the behavior.  Of equal importance is ensuring that the interests of the organizational effectiveness, other employees and agency clients are protected.Disciplinary action should: Prevent recurrences of the actsDeter others from similar conductMaintain the integrity of the programPrecedent and consistency are further considerations.TimelinesThe disciplinary action process can be time consuming as well as emotionally charged for all parties involved.  Factors to consider:When considering all the factors in determining whether disciplinary action should be taken and what level to take it, it is important, to the extent possible, to maintain consistency within the University and to treat similarly situated employees similarly.  This means that if conditions, circumstances, history, etc., are the same or similar in a given situation, consistent treatment should be given to the employees.  To assist in maintaining consistency and continuity, it is important to involve HRS as soon as possible in these processes.  Recommendation for Formal Disciplinary Action – Pre-Disciplinary Written NoticeSupervisor or Appointing Authority, with the assistance of HRS, writes a pre-disciplinary notice letter that includes:Specific detail as to the reason disciplinary action is being consideredDescription of specific actions or behaviorSupporting Information/Facts (including dates and names)Prior corrective/disciplinary actions, may be considered.Possible action(s) being considered and the fact that no decision will be made until after the employee has the opportunity to present either in writing or in person their side of the issue.Date, time and place for pre-disciplinary meeting.  The meeting must be scheduled during employee’s normal work shift.Include the option to respond in writing instead of having the meeting.  The employee has to be given a chance to present their side either at the pre-disciplinary meeting or in writing.  Both are optional for the employee and the employee can forgo the opportunity to present their side.The letter is given to employee by hand or regular and certified mail if the employee is not at work.Pre-disciplinary Meeting The meeting typically includes the supervisor, appointing authority, Human Resources, employee, and if requested by employee a co-worker.Inform the employee of the concerns , basis for concerns, and range of action contemplated.Give the employee opportunity to:respond to concerns,provide information,give reasons why disciplinary action should not be taken.The employee may waive the pre-disciplinary meeting and/or provide their response in writing if they so choose.Levels of Formal Disciplinary Action (Requires Approval of Appointing Authority) The Appointing Authority list can be found at Appointing Authority. Suspension without pay.  Notice is to be hand delivered or sent regular and certified mailed no later than one day after first day of suspension. Not to exceed 15 days for single penalty or 30 calendar days in calendar year.Reduction in salary.  Notice given 15 days before effective date.Demotion. Notice given 15 days before effective date.Dismissal. Notice given 15 days before effective date.Immediate dismissal.  Appointing authority must determine that retention of employee could result in damage to property or persons.Notice periods exclude the first day and include the last day of the period.Considerations when Determining Level of Formal Disciplinary Action should include the following as appropriate.  This is not an exhaustive list.Length of service.Overall documented performance including performance evaluation.Degree of seriousness of misconduct or inadequate performance.Previous incidents or similar actions.Relevant trainings or prior notice to the employee of expectations, policies, etc.AttendanceCommendationsInitiating Formal ActionAfter pre-disciplinary meeting, the appointing authority decides whether or not formal disciplinary action is to be taken.  If the appointing authority had a proxy represent them at the pre-disciplinary meeting, he/she discusses meeting with proxy.The appointing authority with assistance from HRS, drafts letter to employee, delivered by hand or by regular and certified mail if employee is not at work.If disciplinary action is to be taken, letter states the charges, supporting information, that a pre-disciplinary meeting was held or offered, employee’s perspective as presented in the pre-disciplinary meeting (could be included if appropriate but not always necessary or appropriate), disciplinary action being taken, and appeal rights.Disciplinary letter is sufficiently specific that employee can respond to the charges without further information.AppealThe employee may appeal formal disciplinary action within 30 days of the effective date of action to the Personnel Resources Board (PRB). For example if the employee is given a 15-day notice of termination, the 30 days begins on the date of separation from employment.

31,documents/compensation.doc,hr,,"Compensation EditionWhen are we going to get a pay raise?The CSUEU contract describes general compensation in Article 20.  Pay for specific classifications is available at the Chancellor’s web site.  The contract lists any General Salary Increase (GSI) and any step increases (SSI).  The CSU has not funded GSI or SSI since 2007 which has led to stagnant pay for staff employees.  GSI and SSI can only be increased through negotiations and the willingness and ability of the employer to fund them.Is there any other way to get a raise or get to the top of the pay range?The union contract provides for campus increases which are not tied to the systemwide increases.  These increases are permanent (In-Range Progression, reclassification, In-Class Progression) or temporary (lead stipends, project stipends, on-call pay, bonuses and reassignment).	Permanent Increases	In-Range Progression – Movement within your current pay range based on enhanced skills, retention, equity, performance, new and permanent lead work, or other criteria (see 20.40).	In-Class Progression – Movement between skill levels of the same classification based upon permanent assignment of higher skill level responsibilities (see 9.25).	Reclassification – Promotion to a new classification based upon permanent assignment of higher skill level responsibilities in a different classification or recruitment into a posted higher-level position (see 9.26).	Temporary Increases	Reassignment – Basically the same as In-Class Progression or reclass but on a temporary basis (see 17.4).	Stipends – Employees are paid stipends if they are temporarily assigned lead duties for other employees (including students and foundation employees) or project coordination or are required to be on-call (see 20.42).	Bonuses – A lump sum payment for performance on an individual or group basis, recruitment, retention, or critical skills (see 20.38).Should employees get to the top of the pay range?Prior to 1996, all employees were expected to reach the top of the pay range through annual step increases.  This 100% became only 1% when steps were unilaterally eliminated by the CSU Chancellor’s Office in bargaining.  Restoration of the step system and funding is a major goal for union negotiators.What is the process for an IRP?Procedures for the campus are posted on the Human Resources web page.  Either employees or supervisors may request an IRP for an employee.  There are two requirements – merit and funding.Merit is based on the criteria listed in 20.40.  Some suggestions for proving merit:	Enhanced skills – Documentation of training or new higher-skilled assignments that are now a pat of your regular job duties.  This may also be documented in your performance evaluation.	Retention – Other job offers or job postings by other employers which show higher pay for similar duties.	Performance – Consistently high scores on performance evaluations, letters of commendation and thanks, documentation of a project well done.	New lead duties – Documentation of new employees (including students and foundation employees) who are assigned to someone who has not had lead duties before.	Project coordination – Documentation of new projects which require special attention or effort.	Equity – This is determined by Human Resources and is based on whether you are paid substantially less than other employees in your classification with your same service history.Funding is based on available funds in the department or unit.  There are no campus funds specifically devoted to In-Range Progression.What about bonuses?The criteria for In-Range Progression are almost the same for bonuses.  The same documentation would be useful.  If the reasons for the increase involve permanent changes, then the employee should request IRP; if the reasons are short-term, then bonuses are appropriate. What about reclassification and In-Class Progression?Reclassification and In-Class Progression use the same process.  An employee requests a reclassification review and a classifier in Human Resources reviews the current position.  The classifier is expected to review the assigned duties against the duties listed in statewide classification standards to determine the correct classification for the duties.Unlike IRP and bonuses, reclassification and In-Class Progression are not discretionary.  If an employee is working out-of-class on a permanent basis, then the employee must be reclassified or the duties must be removed.What can be done to improve employee career advancement?On the statewide level, we must all work for a contract that restores step increases and provides cost of living increases.  On the local level, we can encourage the Campus President to set aside funds for IRP and bonuses in the campus budget and work with Human Resources to create objective and transparent procedures for reclassification and In-Class Progression.  The most important element in all of these is an educated and active work force.Who should I contact if I need more information or help on work issues?Chief Steward:  Sally Divis (760-750-4130)Unit Representatives:   BU 2 – Vacant; BU 5 – Vacant; BU 7 – Eli Samano; BU 9 – Steve WienerStewards:  Debbie Blair, James Carr, Mike Geck, JanetLynn Mosemak, Shauna Mendez, Pam Ohrazda, Pete RauchLabor Relations Representative:  Brian Young (619-426-4306)"

33,documents/Creating-a-Pay-Structure.docx,finance,,"GO FURTHER.Creating a Pay StructureWhy bother creating a formal pay structure?There are a variety of reasons why a formal structure makes sense for companies of all sizes. Many smaller organizations argue that they need more flexibility, but flexibility without guidelines or goal alignment is not supportive of good business practices. Organizations run into the many of the following issues when their pay structures are arbitrary:Recruitment Issues:Your applicant pool is low (if you post pay) or applicants back out of job offers, and you believe the reason might be that your pay is not competitive.You unintentionally perpetuate wage disparities between men and women by basing pay not on experience or market rate but based on their pay at a previous job.You can’t advertise your positions with a pay rate internally or externally because you worry someone will be upset at the disparity between their pay and the vacant position.Internal Equity Issues:You pay on a negotiation basis – Some people demand and get more; others are less vocal and therefore get less. Your pay is not based on the job or on merit, but instead on caving to applicant and employee demands.When you want to promote someone, you find they are already paid more than their boss.You can’t price your positions to market because some are at-market, some are above-market, and some are well below market (and you have no clearly defined business purpose for the inconsistency).Liability Concerns:You find that someone in a protected class has – for whatever reason – failed to keep up with pay increases like other staff and you have no idea how to defend your organization in the case of a discrimination claim.You have one very important person whose pay continues to rise because you “can’t” lose them, and now their pay is very out of line, putting you at risk.Morale/Turnover:Employees are gossiping and complaining to one another about pay but you can’t speak to their concerns because there was no original logic behind the process and the system is now very hard to correct.You continue to have people note pay or lack of pay transparency on their exit surveys as the reason they are leaving your organization.To summarize, you need a pay structure to help you be consistent, fair and transparent. This will help you attract and retain staff and will build trust and engagement with your team.Now that I know why a formal pay structure is important, what do I do?Make sure you have the support of the executive team in the form of a clear “go ahead” with a commitment to review and take action on the findings. As compensation is a sensitive topic and requires financial commitment and tough decisions, it is often a project that gets dropped once executive staff realize the scope of the project and the work it entails.To develop a pay structure, you must understand your organization’s strategic goals related to pay so that you can ensure your structure supports those goals.Ask your executive staff what they consider your total rewards strategy to be (to include pay, benefits, training, incentives, etc. – all of the ways that you reward and incentivize staff.) This may be a new concept in some organizations, but the goal is to help your team align your pay philosophy and total rewards strategy with your company culture, the outside competition, and your strategic goals. Without a sense of direction, you cannot move forward on your project. Some questions to ask internally as you consider your strategy might be:Can the company afford to pay at market or above market for the area or marketplace in which you compete (or are your finances limited at this time, and are you considering paying below market)?How difficult is it to recruit in your area and how important is it to get the best employees?Is pay vital to your recruiting and talent plans?What are your benefits – Do they allow you to stay at market with pay and still give you an edge?How will your benefits need to change to continue attracting the talent you need?Surveys of employees – what do they say is important to them?Are there growth opportunities in your organization or are people in their current role long-term?Do your working conditions supplement or detract from your pay and benefits?What is your culture/mission/values and how should those apply to your philosophy?Review this document in full and present a project plan to the executive team so they understand the process and the timeline. This will also allow them to question or object to the program if it is not in line with the company goals at the time. (For example, if you feel that you need an outside resource for surveys or market data, it is important to get the buy-in for the cost of the consultants and for the timeline on which they will execute. If executive staff need to be present at meetings or make decisions at certain points in the project, make that clear as well.)What is a pay philosophy?A pay philosophy describes your strategy for the use of pay in incentivizing, rewarding and engaging staff. It doesn’t just include how frequently you price to market or how you manage your annual increase process – it also includes how transparent your process will be, how important it is for your pay structure to encourage growth in the organization or encourage retention without growth opportunities being available. As you can imagine, this philosophy is very unique to your organization and sometimes is needs to be specific enough to address certain positions or divisions within the organization. The questions in the section above can help your executive staff better understand the goals that need to be met with pay and total rewards. Determining goals will help to create a philosophy specific to your organization that addresses those goals and needs.One of the key pieces of your pay philosophy is to determine how you will “price your positions” – to include which region, industry and job title will be matched to each role. You will need to determine which of the following options you may decide to follow in pricing your positions (or, of course, you may choose somewhere in-between).Lead the market (generally matching the salary at the 75th percentile or above in salary surveys)Match the market (around the 50th percentile)Lag the market (around the 25th percentile)Often a pay philosophy may refer to the total rewards philosophy as well. Here is an example of a pay philosophy for a cutting-edge technology company: “We want to be a market leader in innovation, so we are 25% above market rate for most positions. We believe in rewarding and retaining top talent, so we have a detailed and rigorous individual review which provides for large incentive bonuses annually for top performers, a company bonus based on overall performance and a universal cost of living increase of up to 3%.” The overall total rewards strategy might also include putting money into tuition reimbursement to keep skills sharp, for example.Here is an example of a pay philosophy for a family run business with stable, low skilled workers in a non-competitive market environment: “We believe that our employees are family and deserve to be paid the market rate for their roles. While our pay may not lead the market, our employees find great pleasure in working here because they appreciate our comprehensive medical and disability protections as well as the robust 401k contributions.”Pay philosophies can change over time and should be reviewed periodically. As an example, if the family run business described in the example above projects a large number or people retiring in the next few years, they will have to look at available talent in their area and what that talent is seeking for in a job. If it is younger talent, maybe the medical and retirement benefits come second to higher pay.A good pay philosophy addresses those headaches we mentioned at the beginning of this article, by focusing on:EquityAny liability concernsCompetitiveness to marketHow exceptions will be handled (someone long-term who is maxed out on their pay grade, as an example).TransparencyEntry pay and flexibility for attracting talentFinancial incentives and rewards – how you motivate and retain talentHow do I go about building a pay structure?This will depend based on your company’s size, complexity and administrative capabilities. Small companies may simply price out individual positions. Even organizations that are mid-sized may have a limited number of jobs and see no need to create complex job bands.If you are seeking to create a more complex structure, it is ideal to have an outside partner. A more complex structure might include developing competencies and arranging positions into different competency levels in order to price out groups of positions with aligned competencies. In this case, outside support may be needed to ensure that the process is accomplished efficiently. Bear in mind that your executive team will likely have an emotional response to some of the findings of the pay review. They will not want to address issues such as a direct report who is significantly overpaid. Your judgement may be right on track, but having an outside professional who has experience in compensation analysis sometimes provides the “outside expert” that you need to gain an acceptance of that fact.Sometimes those who are new to structuring compensation begin by looking at salary survey data (discussed later) just to see where the company currently sits with its competition in the marketplace. If you do so and you haven’t had a true philosophy for your pay in the past, you may find yourself becoming confused as you see different parts of the organization behaving in different ways, either due to manager philosophy or due to different divisional needs. Remember that all pay structures are not the same. Consider the difficulties of your organization and think through what structure might help you to resolve those obstacles administratively. Here are some examples of ways of the kinds of issues that might come up, and how you might decide to address them.Your company has one division mainly staffed by remote workers which are in high demand. You are competing nationally and sometimes internationally for a limited pool of talent. The remainder of your organization is based in a small city with a fairly low cost of living and high unemployment.In this case you might choose to have two different salary structures. The high demand structure might be a “market leader” targeting the 75th percentile of salaries for each job and might even base that percentile from a larger city/region’s salary data. The remainder of the company might be at or above market for the region where it is located.You have a wide range of roles with most roles likely being priced within the same geography and lead/lag philosophy. However, your roles don’t seem to fit from a salary range perspective. You have attempted to create ranges for similar roles, but the ranges are becoming too wide, and while you might be able to narrow it down by specifying which jobs take up which part of the range, it seems confusing and divisive. Therefore, you choose to split your ranges into three divisional categories which require just a few simple grades in each one. These are often called “job families.”How do I go about “pricing” my positions?Review Job Descriptions: Make sure your job descriptions are clear and up to date. To price positions, you must be able to match job duties to outside salary surveys. Titles vary, so duties are the real test of a “match.”Decide on the jobs you’ll price: Sometimes instead of pricing each job, it makes sense to choose a representative benchmark job for a job group. Generally, it is important to benchmark at least 70% of the employees and to have the total number of jobs priced between 50 – 65% of the total job titles. However, the key is accuracy.Remember that the job description you use as your benchmark should be the job in that area which encompasses the most similar tasks across jobs and is most representative. Find surveys relevant to your organization: These may be regional surveys, such as Catapult’s (free to members) or national surveys (Catapult participates in those as well). Avoid using survey data which does not include a large sample or is a free “survey” from the web with little back up information on how the survey was conducted. Try to have two surveys at minimum so you can have at least two data sets for each job. However, if you can only find one survey with the job on it, and there are plenty of relevant participants, you may have to do your best with what you have. In addition to Catapult surveys which can be found on our website, Catapult offers members the ability to review pay for 50 free jobs on PayFactors.Look for data specific to your industry and to your region. An HR Manager at a plant in Alabama is going to be paid differently than an HR Manager at a high-tech company in New York City. Industry and professional organizations are great places to go for specific data.Match your benchmark jobs to the jobs in the surveys: Make clear notes about which jobs you matched and why; it may be important for the next step, and for any challenges that may come your way as you discuss the numbers with your executive team. For example, if a job seems to be at a lower level than yours because of the scope of the role, the size of the companies participating in the survey, or simply because your company is fairly unique as to number of sites covered or complexity of data, you should note this.Verify and correct data:Look for odd data. For example, if you have three surveys and one survey indicates that a job is paid 30% higher than both other surveys, try to figure out why and adjust. Generally, companies look at the 50th percentile and average upon that data point, but you might choose higher or lower in the case that you are choosing to lead or lag the market. Some ways to make adjustments include:Throwing out the data from one survey if it seems completely irrelevant (low number of participants or incorrect industry). For example, if you are a small non-profit and most of the participants in your non-profit surveys are hospitals which traditionally pay more than smaller non-profits, you might choose to throw out the data point altogether.Adjust the data: If your data is from another region of the country, determine the cost-of-living variables between the two regions or cities and decrease or increase the salary point appropriately.When you tagged jobs for a match, you will have noted anything that seemed “off” or “mismatched.” This is a good time to review your notes and the salary data points. You may choose to make some minor adjustments up or down based on those notes (generally if you are exceeding 20% above or below the data point, you need to choose other piece of job data.)Average data from multiple surveys: You may choose to weight as a simple average with number of employers or employees in the survey, or if you feel one survey is extremely relevant, you might weight it double in the average.Age data – Sometimes the only survey you can find that seems relevant is also somewhat out of date as compared to the other surveys. If it is more than a year or two old, you may simply want to not use the data. However, you can choose to age the data over a year or two by determining the number of months between the dates of the surveys and assigning that percent of an annual aging factor to be added to the older data. That factor could be COLA, CPI or internal average increases.Compare current pay to market data:Using current pay for your employees, determine the outliers. Generally, you will specifically target those over or under 20% below the data point you have used as your average. This should give you an idea of whether you have selected a good match or not. If all of your employees (throughout the company) are below market, that at least shows consistency. You are especially looking for cases that are outside the norm for your company so that you can investigate further – is it a survey issue or an internal issue?This is also a good time to have a follow-up conversation with your executive team. Are they surprised by the data? What are their initial reactions? This will help them begin absorbing the results of the survey and begin thinking about next steps. Often you may get push back at this time stating that you must have your numbers wrong. Make sure you have your back-up with you and reiterate that you have followed the standard procedure of identifying matching jobs by job duties and discuss how you have adjusted the data to match.Group the jobs into grades and consider if multiple job families are necessary.If your jobs are radically different from one another in separate divisions of the company, you might choose to have separate job grades for certain job families. (For example, Administrative and Operations could each be a job family with their own set of job grades and pay structure.There are many ways to group jobs together. The most complicated and least used is the Point-Factor Method, which is generally best facilitated by an outside organization (Contact Becky Drozdz, HR Advisor, Compensation at 704.522.8011 or  becky.drozdz@letscatapult.org if you need assistance evaluating your pay strategy, or cost of labor for multiple locations. Catapult’s member website includes wage and salary surveys, both regional and national, and Catapult offers members the ability to review pay for 50 free jobs on PayFactors. If you are performing the analysis yourself, you may consider simpler methods, such as:Ranking jobs by perceived value in relation to the other jobs at the company. For smaller companies, this may be easy to do. As the organization gets more complex, division heads and executives may have a more difficult time coming to agreement and will tend to perceive that the jobs relevant to their own success, and those which they understand the complexities of, are more important.Setting up some pre-determined skill and responsibility levels in order to create a set of grades, then classifying your jobs based on their job description. This process should involve factors that you determine as a company, and HR staff should individually assist managers in the process so that they can ask questions and try to ensure common decision making between management. Final decisions may be run by the compensation committee as a whole to discuss any areas of concern.All of these methods require agreement from the organization on what factors are important as it can be easy to argue that one job should be bumped to the next grade level, significantly changing the pay for the role. None of these methods take market pay levels into account, so there may need to be additional discussions if there is a job with a market pay which is outside the general grade for the level of responsibility and skill.Create pay ranges for each job grade:The pay range for a position will depend on how precise the job grade is (how many jobs it encompasses and what differentiates those jobs), the amount of growth or longevity in a particular role, the length of time that it takes to become proficient in the role (complexity) and the range of decision-making and expanse of responsibility of the jobs within a role. Keep the considerations above in mind when considering the following decision points:Midpoint: This is the point which you will determine using the appropriate percentile in your salary surveys (lagging, meeting or leading the market). The midpoint is the point at which someone has become proficient at thejob. For many jobs, this may be 2-3 years. Some individuals with experience may come into a particular role nearly at this level, only needing another year of relevant industry/company experience to be proficient in their role.Minimum and maximum of range: This is generally not set based on market data as the midpoint may be, as the market data can vary and result in arbitrary ranges. Ranges vary based on the grade. As an example, for a role which is entry-level and takes only a few months of experience to become proficient, the minimum may not be far below the mid-point of the range, and the maximum that you are willing to pay may not be much above the mid-point. For that reason, lower-level, less complex roles generally have a narrower range.On the other hand, more senior positions may have a very wide range and the job duties, knowledge and responsibilities may vary significantly. For example, a VP of HR has responsibility for overall company compliance and direction, whereas a VP of Sales may have a more limited scope (the sales processes). Two different division directors may manage divisions of varying size and complexity. Sometimes the job grades may differ, sometimes the ranges may be wider to encompass all of the required roles. It is part of your job to talk with the executive team about the structure that makes the most sense for your organization – Multiple pay structures per division? Wider ranges? Additional job grades?Salary range spreads (min to max) can vary from 30 – 60%. To find a minimum and a maximum when you already have your midpoint, decide a target for the width of your range, then use the following calculations:Minimum = 	Midpoint                            (1 + (width/2))Example: if your midpoint is 25K, and you want a 30% spread, you would divide $25K by (1 + 30%/2), or 1.15.$25,000 divided by 1/15 is 21,739.13 which would be the minimum of your range.Maximum = Minimum * 1 + width In this case 1 + width would be 1.3), so 21,739.13 multiplied by 1.3 is the maximum of the range: 28,260.87Range overlap and Midpoint progression:Range overlap: Ranges that are closely related generally overlap to some extent. For example, a new lead retail salesperson may make less than someone who has been a retail associate for 5 years. Too much overlap, and it may not encourage advancement; too little and it can artificially inflate the value of the related position.Although you may have already built salary ranges, you might choose to tweak the minimum and maximum to adjust the range spread or overlap.Midpoint progression indicates the distance between midpoints. Midpoint Difference (expressed as percentage) = Higher Midpoint – Lower Midpoint          Lower Midpoint Compensation analysts have different philosophies on midpoint progression, some advocating that all midpoints have the same differential. In the case that is your goal, it may mean having “empty” salary grades which can be confusing if you are trying to be transparent about your salary structure. However, it can also be confusing when grade differentials are significantly different from one position to another (why did Juan get a 45% increase for a change to a new pay grade when I only got a 20% increase)?Other experts believe midpoint progression should be based on the level of the job, ranging from 5 - 30% depending on the level of the role. Consider your goals with your plan and choose the method that works best for you. No matter what you decide, running the numbers each time to review and update your grades is a good quick check to identify potential concerns.Review your internal findings and adjust ranges if needed.Run your actual staff pay against the ranges to find any outliers. Make sure when doing so that you are comparing apples to apples (if someone works part-time, make sure the pay is expressed as full-time for comparison). Here are some good points of data to review:Under midpoint or above max? (If this occurs for a significant number of staff in one area, you may want to review your strategy and survey information again.)Under minimum: Consider a strategy to adjust (immediately or over time) anyone who is below midpoint to the appropriate area of the range.Over max (or close to it): Consider a strategy to avoid the pay issue increasing over time with additional annual increases. For example, consider no longer providing annual increases, and instead providing a lump sum bonus to avoid increasing the base pay rate until your wage range shifts in future salary reviews.Compa-Ratio: Run the compa-ratio for your staff (their individual salaries divided by the midpoint of the salary range multiplied by 100), and sort by hire date. How do the two line up? Compa-ratio is an expression of where your staff fall in the pay range: .9 to 1.1 for a proficient individual is generally a target. New employees would have a lower compa-ratio, and more experienced staff a higher one. (Range Penetration and Market Index analyses are other options to identify your staff’s relationship to the market rate or to the midpoint of your range.)Identify areas of concern to review and correct with executive staff. Remember to make notes as you analyze each situation, so that you will remember your logic and recommendations.If you are in a situation where your company has determined they want to meet the market and find they are lagging by 10%, it may not be in budget to adjust everyone at once. The analysis of how to react will be complex. You can certainly raise starting pay, but this will cause pay compression for staff who have been in place for longer and are now underpaid compared to newer staff.You might choose instead to target a rate two years out (the rate can be reviewed based on salary trends each year) with a number of smaller increases to entry pay and adjustments to overall wages, hoping that your aged rate will bear out when you review salaries in the future. Remember that salary planning is an evolving process which must line up with your evolving goals and strategies and which must be continually reviewed in light of market conditions and wage trends. For this reason, you should review salary to market regularly (many companies choose to do this annually).While the initial salary planning process and wage analysis is a difficult and frustrating one, the ongoing review is much easier, and if you maintain your philosophy in line with strategic goals, you will have a clear path to achieving the targets you have set out for yourself. In addition, your strategy will be clearly defined, well researched and more transparent to your staff.Written by a Catapult Advisor.(866) 440-0302  >  letscatapult.org"

37,documents/managers-new-employee-onboarding-guide.pdf,hr,,"Manager’s New Employee Onboarding GuideWelcome to the University of Houston DowntownEmployment Services & OperationsThe University of Houston-Downtown strategic onboarding program is designed for a high level of interaction that is tailored to both the individual’s and the department’s needs. A strong onboarding process will accelerate employee engagement and performance. Our onboarding process starts during the recruitment process and becomes formal when an offer is accepted.Definition of TermsOrientation:In most cases New Employee Orientation (NEO) occurs on the new employee’s start date. The new employee in-processes to the university by completing the appropriate employment forms and receives information about the university’s structure, vision, and mission. An overview of policies, procedures, benefits, training opportunities, the performance appraisal process, other topics of interest, and a campus tour is provided.Onboarding:Acclimating new employees to the university is a long-term process that enables them to become productive and committed to the university. Ensuring the new employee understands their job role and responsibilities, how they contribute to the department, and how the department contributes to the university lends itself to a successful and long-term relationship.Goals of OnboardingWhile orientation is an essential part of our onboarding program, the university engages new employees beyond orientation at the departmental and organizational levels. We utilize coaching, training, and other developmental programs to assimilate new employees to the university, instilling a sense of pride and commitment to UHD. Positive employee onboarding experiences also advance operational excellence.Expected outcomes of an exceptional onboarding program:Employee Experience• • Pride and commitment to UHDIncreased employee satisfaction Increased employee engagementOperational ExcellenceStandardized onboarding experience across all departments • • Increased employee retention Increased cost effectiveness2Stages of OnboardingStage 1Pre-hire: This is the first stage of the onboarding process. First impressions are being formed here.Stage 2General Briefing: Provide detailed and relevant information about the university to the candidate. Make sure that all discussions are healthy, productive and not confrontational. Ensure that you are as informative as possible about every aspect of employment: compensation, job expectations, university culture, benefits, etc.Stage 3New Employee Orientation Day: Leverage your new employee’s enthusiasm. Properly welcome them to UHD by attending their NEO lunch meeting or by providing a representative from your department.Stage 4Department Orientation: The orientation program happens in two phases. The first phase, NEO, is facilitated by Employment Services and Operations. The second phase is your department’s orientation where you will discuss their job expectations and how their role contributes to the success of your team, department and the university. You may personalize the orientation by providing an informal breakfast or lunch meeting to welcome your new employee to your department and existing staff. Importantly, do not overwhelm your new employee by providing too much information on their first day.Stage 5Post Orientation: This is the continuation of the onboarding process. Details can be found on page four of this guide (Manager’s Checklist for Onboarding New Employees).Onboarding does not end after 30, 60, or even 90 days. It is an ongoing process that usually continues until the employee’s first year anniversary. This may seem like a long time, but resignations often occur within an employee’s first year.Therefore, it is especially important to ensure your new employee feels welcomed and empowered to make an impact from the day they start. To help facilitate an effective department onboarding experience, please refer to the Manager’s Checklist on page four.Happy onboarding!

40,documents/staff-sick-leave-policy.pdf,hr,,"SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITYSTAFF SICK LEAVE POLICYProcedure Number: Classification: Responsible University Office: Vice President Human ResourcesVersion Number: 4 Effective Date: 01/01/20181.0 INTRODUCTIONFrom time to time employees will miss work due to illness or injury. Saint Louis University provides paid sick leave as part of its total compensation and commitment to its employees.2.0 PURPOSEThe eligibility and reporting requirements for sick leave are clearly explained to ensure accurate reporting and administration.3.0 PERSONNEL AFFECTEDThis policy applies to all regular part time and full time staff at Saint Louis University, with the exception of employees in a collective bargaining unit or employees of the Madrid campus.4.0 DEFINITIONSNot applicable5.0 POLICYPaid sick leave is intended to protect regular staff members from loss of income because of the employee's inability to work due to illness or injury.6.0 RESPONSIBLITIESIt is the responsibility of the employee to report the circumstances of the sick leave, recovery progress, and probable duration of the sick leave. The reason for sick leave may be covered under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. (See FMLA Policy.)Individuals wishing to maintain confidentiality regarding the reason for a sick leave request may consult with Human Resources for confidential handling. The individual or supervisor may also contact Human Resources to verify eligibility and amount of accrued sick leave available.Staff members should make every effort to schedule medical appointments outside normal working hours; however, if it is impossible to do so, sick time may be used for medical appointments if approved in advance by the supervisor.Upon separation, unused sick leave cannot be used as necessary notice for resignation. Unused sick leave is not paid upon separation but will be reinstated to a staff member's sick leave balance if the individual returns to Saint Louis University within one year of the separation date.7.0 PROCEDURES7.1 EligibilityFull-time regular staff members accrue sick days at the rate of 13 days per year. Part-time regular staff members who work 40 hours per pay period or more or are .5 FTE or higher accrue sick days prorated on the number of hours worked in a pay period. The rate is .05 hours of sick time for each hour worked. Sick days may be carried over from one year to the next to a maximum of 130 days (1,040 hours) to ensure that such days are available in the event of a long-term illness. However, no staff member is paid for accrued unused sick days at the time of termination. Sick pay is paid for scheduled workdays. Sick pay does not cover absences due to weather conditions or personal business.7.2 Sick Leaves of Less than 3 Consecutive Work Days7.2.1Staff members who are unable to report to work due to illness or injury are required to notify their supervisors at the earliest opportunity, in accordance with department policy. An employee who must leave work due to illness or sick leave condition should likewise advise his/her supervisor in accordance with department policy.7.2.2Sick leaves of three work days or less normally do not require medical verification; however, verification may be required for any absence due to illness or injury if the University has a reason to question the appropriateness of the absence or its duration, even if one day or less. Failure to produce the verification within 15 calendar days of the absence may result in the absence not being recorded as sick time.7.2.3 The staff member may submit a Request for FMLA/Leave of Absence form if the reason for thesick leave is covered under the FMLA Policy or if the duration of the sick leave may extend beyond 3 work days. (See FMLA Policy.)7.2.4 The department should retain any documents generated for sick leave requests in separateconfidential files.7.3 Sick Leaves Greater than 3 Consecutive Work Days7.3.1 The employee or employee's representative notifies the supervisor of the need for sick leave ofmore than 3 consecutive days.7.3.2 The individual is required to submit a Request for Family and Medical Leave and Certification of Healthcare Provider form 30 calendar days prior to the commencement of the leave if the leave is foreseeable, or as soon as practicable if the leave is not foreseeable or sick leave pay may be canceled. ""As soon as practicable"" ordinarily would mean at least verbal notification within 1 or 2 work days of when the need for leave becomes known to the employee. (See FMLA Policy and forms.)7.3.3 As soon as sufficient information is provided by the staff member, he/she will be provided the""Response to Your Request for Leave"" form which will indicate whether the reason for the leave meets the requirements for FMLA leave or Leave of Absence.

HRD researchers should engage in ""...developing performance-based intervention models, investigating socialization-related learning, developing instruments to diagnose adaptation problems, designing interventions to facilitate the process, testing alternative development strategies, evaluation intervention outcomes, and establishing the return on investment of interventions. Because socialization is a process, not a program, it will require the development of structured on-the-job development strategies as well as training interventions"" (p. 75).

McGillGeneral Guidelines for FY13 BonusDHRM Policy and Guidance The Department of Human Resource Management distributed a memorandum dated July 12, 2012, entitled Fiscal Year 2013 Authorizations and Compensation Activities.  Within this document DHRM provides an explanation of the policies related to the FY 13 bonus. http://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/compensation/communication/FiscalYear13AuthandCompensationActivities.pdf Additionally, DHRM will provide more information in the form of Frequently Asked Questions posted to its website in the near future. http://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/compensation/communication/BonusFAQsfor2012.pdf This bulletin only provides guidance relative to how the bonus is to be processed in CIPPS.Bonus Payment and Taxing Bonus payments will be paid in a single payment (check or direct deposit) along with the employee’s regular November 30, 2012, pay date earnings.  The bonus special pay will be taxed in conjunction with the employee’s salary received for that pay date using the employee’s tax profile (i.e., marital status, number of exemptions) in accordance with IRS regulations as defined in IRS Publication 15, Section 7, “Supplemental Wages.”Agencies Using PMIS For those agencies that enter data into PMIS, DHRM will produce a file for use within CIPPS providing the “925” transactions (for Special Pay 025) in the applicable amounts for those eligible employees.  The input file should be available approximately November 19, 2012, for loading into CIPPS.  Agencies will need to adjust bonus amounts manually on payroll records for any employees whose salaries change (effective November 24, 2012, or earlier) after the November 16, 2012, PMIS file extract.		Continued on next pageGeneral Guidelines for FY13 Bonus, cont.Agencies NOT Using PMIS Agencies that do not enter data into PMIS should enter Special Pay transactions on HUE01 using the following indicators: tax – 5; check – 0; and deduction – 0.Review of DHRM Transactions It is the responsibility of each agency to verify the appropriateness and accuracy of the transactions loaded/entered and take corrective action where necessary.  Temporary pay should not be included in the determination of the bonus amount. The night the DHRM file is loaded to CIPPS the bonus transactions will appear on the Report 1001, Input Transaction Listing.  DHRM will batch the bonus transactions by semi-monthly and monthly pay schedules.  Batch number 9999 will be used for those transactions created for employees paid semi-monthly.  Batch number 9998 will be used for those transactions created for employees paid on a monthly basis.  A subsequent edit will produce the Report 1004, Transactions Balance Report.  As with the Report 1001, this report should be reviewed to verify the appropriateness and accuracy of the bonus payment amounts.Tax Deferral of Bonus Payment DHRM (FAQs for the 2012 Bonus) and VRS (October Focus, the quarterly newsletter for defined contribution plans participants) guidance related to tax deferral of the bonus payment through contribution to the 457 Deferred Compensation Plan has been or will be issued soon.  Please note that the Payroll Authorization One-Time Deferral form must be completed and submitted to the Payroll Office no later than OCTOBER 31 for the bonus to be contributed to the 457 Plan.  On the One-Time Deferral form (link below), the employee should indicate the dollar amount they wish to contribute to the Plan or “Net” if they want the total (after applicable withholding) contributed.  https://vadcp.ingplans.com/einfo/pdfs/forms/virgna/650271/payroll_onetime.pdf Employees not currently enrolled in the 457 Plan must enroll by October 1, 2012.  The contribution of the bonus counts toward the participant’s annual contribution limit.  To determine the full amount deferrable, use the Maximum Deferral Calculations Spreadsheet found on DOAs website at the (http://www.doa.virginia.gov/Payroll/Forms/Payroll_Forms_Main.cfm). For deferrals to a 403(b) annuity plan, employees currently enrolled with an annuity provider must provide written authorization to the employing agency of the amount to be deferred, authorizing an increase to the current annuity contribution.  For example, a form stating, “I want $xxx of my November 30, 2012 bonus to be contributed to my 403(b) plan” with the employee’s signature will suffice.  A new Salary Reduction Authorization form DOES NOT need to be completed.  Participants are responsible for ensuring any additional contribution does not cause total 2012 contributions to exceed IRS limits.Continued on next pageGeneral Guidelines for FY13 Bonus, cont.Tax Deferral of Bonus Payment, cont. This is a one-time exception to the established FBMC change process.  However, to facilitate review and posting of the November 30, 2012, annuity payroll, FBMC requests that each agency provide a listing of those employees affected.  Please include the employee name, SSN, and amount of the bonus contribution to their plan.  Fax (850-514-5803) or email (tmilton@fbmc.com) the listing to Toni Milton. New enrollees MUST complete a Salary Reduction Authorization form in accordance with established procedures. Once the appropriate documentation has been received by the payroll office, the agency will need to enter a deduction override on HUD01.  When entering deduction override amounts for a one-time increase to the deferral, be sure to enter a + in the adjustment indicator blank as the one-time deferral is to be taken in addition to the previously existing deferral amount.  (See screen print below.) REMEMBER:  The employer-paid cash match is NOT to be paid on deferral amounts from the bonus payment but should be maintained on the normal pay period deferrals.Continued on next pageChange to 2012 Certification ScheduleAdditional Holiday Provided in December The Governor has provided an additional holiday for December 2012.  December 31 has now been given as a paid holiday for the New Year.  Therefore, payday has been moved back to December 28, 2012, and final certification for the December 10 to 24 pay period is moved to December 20.  An updated certification schedule can be found at http://www.doa.virginia.gov/Payroll/Payroll_Certification_Calendar_2012.cfm .New VRS Legislation Prompts “Act Now Campaign”Act Now to Purchase Service Recent legislation will change benefit plan provisions for Plan 1 employees who will not be vested (5 years of service) by January 1, 2013.  VRS has sent communications to all agencies to include a list of employees that may be affected and an indication of possible time that can be purchased by the employee.

47,documents/Number_8.0_DISCIPLINARY_ACTION_AND_CORRECTIVE_ACTION.pdf,hr,,"Number 8.0 - DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONEffective Date:April 1, 2021Subject:Disciplinary Action and Corrective ActionApplicable To:All classified employees within the Executive Branch of the State of Vermont.Issued By:Department of Human ResourcesApproved By:Susanne R. Young, Secretary of AdministrationPURPOSE AND POLICY STATEMENTIt shall be the policy of the State of Vermont to administer discipline fairly, reasonably, and impartially. Employees and the State are best served when discipline is administered to correct actions rather than to punish. Disciplinary action is intended to maintain the efficiency and integrity of State service. Progressive disciplinary actions will generally be used after considering the nature and severity of the offense.It is the responsibility of each supervisor, human resources professional, and appointing authority to evaluate the circumstances and facts as objectively as possible and then apply the most suitable form of discipline. The current collective bargaining agreements (“contract”) between the State of Vermont and its union(s) provide that no member of a bargaining unit will be disciplined except for just cause, and they also contain various procedural requirements applicable to the imposition of discipline.With respect to employees who are not eligible to join bargaining units (employees designated as managerial or confidential) the Personnel Rules and Regulations provide that such employees may not be disciplined except for cause, but the contract provisions regarding discipline do not apply to them. The following discussion of specific contract requirements, therefore, does not necessarily apply to employees who are not members of a bargaining unit. The Department of Human Resources Legal and Labor Relations Divisions should be consulted when discipline for non-bargaining unit employees is under consideration.DEFINITIONS“Progressive Corrective Action” means a systematic method intended to train or correct an employee whose performance is deficient.“Progressive Discipline” means a systematic method intended to correct employee conduct.GENERAL PROCEDURESMany problems can be avoided by keeping communication open between the supervisor and theDISCIPLINARY ACTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION – April 1, 2021Page 1 of 7employee. It is important for supervisors to ensure that employees understand what is expected of them in the performance of their duties. The supervisor should meet with each employee and together develop goals and objectives for the employee's specific job. The Performance Evaluation Report (AA- PER-6C) contains a summary page to describe the major job duties and performance expectations. This summary can be a starting point for outlining the performance expectations for the coming year.Situations may arise where performance issues are not resolved and/or misconduct occurs warranting disciplinary action or progressive corrective action. The disciplinary action article of the current contract must be followed when imposing discipline. Supervisors should further consult the Department of Human Resources Guide to the State Performance Management System.IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONSThe contract outlines two procedures when addressing employee conduct—one for employee misconduct and one for performance deficiencies. Therefore, the first step is to determine whether the circumstance involves employee misconduct or performance deficiency. While the contract does not define such terms, the following principles and guidelines must be considered:A. Employee MisconductAn employee commits misconduct when the employee has failed to comply with the rules of the workplace. An employee's actions need not have been an intentional violation of a rule to be misconduct—negligence in the workplace may be sufficient. For instance, if an employee fails to act as a reasonably prudent person would to carry out the job mission, or is indifferent in carrying out job duties, such actions are misconduct. Thus, if an employee is indifferent to and does not satisfy an important work deadline, this is misconduct. Even in the absence of a deadline, an employee commits misconduct if important interests reasonably calling for prompt action are ignored. Finally, while they may also impact on performance, absenteeism and tardiness are considered to be misconduct.If the employee has committed misconduct, the contract provisions for imposing ""progressive discipline"" will apply. However, there may be instances in which it is appropriate to bypass progressive discipline. If, on the other hand, the employee has a performance problem, the section regarding ""progressive corrective action"" applies. This distinction is extremely important because using the incorrect contractual approach may render the action taken to be legally invalid.Managers and supervisors must consult with the Department of Human Resources when contemplating the imposition of discipline. Technical details such as notice and the wording of disciplinary letters should be reviewed by the Department of Human Resources. All such letters must be reviewed by the Department of Human Resources prior to issuance. This is important because great emphasis has been placed on the wording of disciplinary letters in grievance proceedings.DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION – April 1, 2021Page 2 of 7B. Performance DeficienciesAn employee is considered to be deficient in their job performance when the employee has failed, because of a lack of ability or a shortcoming of judgment, to perform the job to the satisfaction of the employer. If the State has not, through training or rulemaking, made its expectations for employee job performance precisely clear, it is generally a performance problem when the employee falls short of expectations. In some positions, many day-to-day decisions are left to the judgment and discretion of the employee, or assignment of priorities may be left to the employee. Where the employer is not satisfied with the employee's use of judgment or discretion, or assignment of priorities, such a problem is usually appropriately addressed with progressive corrective action. Thus, as an example, in a case where the State left it to the employee's judgment to determine an appropriate course of action, but was dissatisfied with the employee's decision-making, it was found that a written reprimand (which is used to address a misconduct problem) was an inappropriate and invalid response by the employer under the contract.""JUST CAUSE"" DEFINED""Just cause"" is the primary standard against which all discipline will be judged. It contains two distinct elements:1. Notice: The ""just cause"" standard provides that employees may not be disciplined unless they had notice that their conduct was prohibited by the employer. Notice may be express or implied. Notice is express when the employer has prohibited conduct by rule, by training, or by some other form of directive to employees. Notice is implied when, even in the absence of the foregoing, reasonable employees would understand such conduct to be prohibited. For example, reasonable employees know, without being told, that criminal violations in the workplace can lead to discipline. Similarly, reasonable employees know that acts of dishonesty or violence in the workplace are not permitted. Implicit notice exists in such circumstances because, using an objective standard, employees, using common sense, know or should know such behavior to be prohibited in the workplace.2. Reasonableness: The second and ultimate question regarding ""just cause"" is whether the employer acted reasonably in the administration of discipline or corrective action. The standard is an objective one. Thus, in order for there to be ""just cause,"" the employee must have demonstrated a substantial shortcoming detrimental to the employer's interests which the law and sound public opinion recognize as good cause for the action taken by the employer. In other words, there will not be ""just cause"" for discipline where the employee's actions were both insignificant and unrelated to any interest of the State. Minor incidents, however, may accumulate so as to provide ""just cause"" for serious discipline.DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION – April 1, 2021Page 3 of 7OTHER IMPORTANT CONTRACT PRINCIPLESThe following standards and principles should be followed when applying disciplinary or correction action:1. Uniformity and Consistency of Discipline: The contract provides that the State will ""apply discipline or corrective action with a view toward uniformity and consistency."" Appointing authorities should take into consideration, when deciding on an appropriate action, what action was taken against other employees in similar circumstances. However, the contract should not be taken to mandate rigid standards of uniformity.2. Timeliness of Discipline: The contract also provides that the State will ""act promptly to impose discipline or corrective action within a reasonable time of the offense."" Again, the standard is an objective one, which will take into account individual circumstances of a case. State policies regarding particular subjects should be reviewed to ascertain whether the State has provided a specific time frame for taking certain actions. Such a commitment will be taken into consideration when the promptness of discipline is reviewed. Thus, appointing authorities must be reasonably diligent in conducting investigations and taking disciplinary actions. This is not only the contractual mandate but also good labor relations policy.3. Progressive Discipline: Discipline is imposed in progressively more severe sanctions to alert the employee to the seriousness of misconduct and to deter continued inappropriate actions, except in those cases where the employee's actions justify bypassing one or more steps of progressive discipline or corrective action. Bypassing progressive discipline may be warranted, for example, when the nature of the offense was such that the employee's credibility on the job was irretrievably damaged. It may also be warranted when the employee's actions destroyed the confidence of supervisors or management in the employee's ability to continue effectively in the position. Progressive discipline or corrective action may also be bypassed simply on the basis that the seriousness of the offense alone warrants a severe penalty. It is only very infrequently, however, that performance problems warrant bypassing the contractual steps for progressive corrective action.4. Notice of Right of Representation: The contract requires the employer to inform bargaining unit employees of their right to request the presence of a VSEA representative for certain proceedings. This is the case when: (1) the employee is required by a supervisor or management to give oral or written statements on an issue involving the employee, which may lead to discipline against the employee; and (2) whenever an employee is called to a meeting with management where discipline is to be imposed on the employee. While this requirement is broad, it does have some exceptions. First, the notification requirement does not apply to the informal initial inquiry of the employee by his or her supervisor or management without knowledge or reason to believe that discipline of the employee was a likely possibility. Thus, if the employee is only a witness to allegedDISCIPLINARY ACTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION – April 1, 2021Page 4 of 7wrongdoing by another employee, and is not suspected of any misbehavior, no notice is required. Should the possibility of discipline against such an employee arise in the course of a meeting, it should be interrupted for purposes of giving the notice. Secondly, such a notice is not required when the meeting is called to provide the employee with oral or written notice of performance deficiencies. (See Contract, Article 12, Section 1).5. Pre-Disciplinary (Loudermill) Meeting: Constitutional due process, under the Loudermill decision, State Policy 8.1, and the contract (See Article 14, Section 4), require a specific procedure to be followed whenever a disciplinary suspension of any length or dismissal of a classified State employee. The key components of this process are to provide notice of charges of misconduct in support of the contemplated discipline and the opportunity for the employee to respond to the charges before discipline may be imposed. The contract provides that, ""whenever an appointing authority contemplates suspending or dismissing an employee, the employee will be notified in writing of the reason(s) for such action and will be given an opportunity to respond either orally or in writing."" Such a ""Loudermill"" letter should not be issued without review by the Department of Human Resources, because the contents of the letter may receive strict scrutiny in any subsequent litigation. Employers must comply with the “Loudermill” process prior to dismissal of an employee for unsatisfactory performance. THE TWELVE FACTORSEach disciplinary action is considered in the context of twelve factors which are typically relevant to evaluating the appropriateness of a penalty. Since such factors will be used to evaluate the propriety of an action which is the subject of a grievance, appointing authorities must consider them when determining whether, and to what extent, disciplinary action is imposed. The twelve factors are as follows:1. The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated.2. The employee's job level and type of employment including supervisory or fiduciary role, contacts with the public and prominence of the position.3. The employee's past disciplinary record.4. The employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability.5. The effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors' confidence in the employee's ability to perform assigned duties.6. Consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similarDISCIPLINARY ACTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION – April 1, 2021Page 5 of 7offenses.7. Consistency of the penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties.8. The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency.9. The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense or had been warned about the conduct in question.10. Potential for the employee's rehabilitation.11. Mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice, or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter.12. The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.CORRECTIVE ACTION IN PERFORMANCE CASESA. Order of Progressive Corrective Action:Appointing authorities should follow the following procedure when assessing corrective action for performance deficiencies:1. Oral or written notice of performance deficiency;2. Written performance evaluation, special or annual, that specifies a prescriptive period for remediation, normally three (3) to six (6) months;3. Warning period of thirty (30) days to three (3) months that can be extended for a period of up to six (6) months;4. Dismissal.B. Procedure for Implementing Corrective Action:The following steps should be implemented when administering corrective action:1. The supervisor should give employees performance standards and expectations and a fair opportunity to improve sub-standard performance.2. Periodic discussions should be held to review the employee's performance progress.DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION – April 1, 2021Page 6 of 73. Performance evaluations, notices of performance deficiencies, performance standards, and performance review notes should be discussed with the employee. Such discussions should make it clear when performance is considered to be unsatisfactory.4. Employees should know before being placed into a prescriptive period for remediation or warning period that there are performance problems, and specifically what they are.5. Performance expectations or standards should be reasonable, unambiguous, job-related, and, to the extent possible, objectively verifiable.6. Employers should have clearly established systems for reviewing corrective action to ensure it is administered only with the knowledge and support of senior management and the personnel officer.DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN MISCONDUCT CASESA. Order of Progressive Discipline for Misconduct CasesAppointing authorities should follow the following procedure when assessing disciplinary action for employee misconduct:1. Oral reprimand;2. Written reprimand;3. Suspension without pay;4. Demotion (optional in the State's discretion);6. Dismissal.Employers must comply with the pre-disciplinary process outlined in the Policies, including Policy 8.1, and the contract prior to imposing discipline for misconduct and/or dismissing an employee for unsatisfactory performance.Approved:_____________________________ Susanne R.

The matrix of federal, state, and local laws governing employment are too complex to create a “one-size-fits-all” handbook. These materials are not to be construed as providing legal, accounting, or any other professional service or advice. We strongly advise that you work with experienced legal counsel to develop and implement your own handbook, and before adapting any part of this Sample Handbook for use in your company or organization. Companies operating in more than one state, and even in more than one city in the same state, need to be especially careful because applicable law, particularly in the employment discrimination area, can vary significantly from state to state and even from city to city. It is necessary to update your company policies from time to time to reflect changes in the workforce, employment trends, economic conditions, and state and federal legislation. Laws change and, as a result, the Sample Handbook may not be in compliance with current rules and regulations. In addition, your state or city may have additional or different laws and regulations not contemplated by a particular sample policy.Acknowledgement of Receipt of [Company Name] Employee HandbookI acknowledge that I have received a copy of the [Company Name] Employee Handbook (“Handbook”). I understand that I am responsible for reading and abiding by all policies and procedures in this Handbook, as well as all other policies and procedures of the Company.  I also understand that the purpose of this Handbook is to inform me of the Company’s policies and procedures, and that it is not a contract of employment. Nothing in this Handbook provides any entitlement to me or to any Company employee, nor is it intended to create contractual obligations of any kind. I understand that the Company has the right to change any provision of this Handbook at any time and that I will be bound by any such changes.I expressly agree to the provisions of Part 6, Dispute Resolution, of the Handbook, in which I have agreed to use alternative dispute resolution, in lieu of litigation, as the sole means of resolving any dispute that may arise between the Company and me, subject to the Company’s right to seek injunctive relief. I agree to first seek to mediate any dispute with the Company with a mediator from the American Arbitration Association or similar organization trained and experienced in employment disputes. If mediation is not successful, I agree to submit the dispute to arbitration. I understand that by agreeing to arbitration I waive any right I may have to sue or seek a jury trial.

We wish you every success in your new job, and we hope that you quickly feel at home. This Handbook was developed to describe some of the expectations we have for all of our employees and what you can expect from us. We hope that your experience here will be challenging, enjoyable, and rewarding. Again, welcome![Signing Name][Job Title]Employer Note: This section is where employees are welcomed, preferably by the president or CEO of the company. You may also wish to talk about the history of the company, its growth, its products, its position in the marketplace, etc. This is also an opportunity to communicate about company culture and values. Your message will create one of the first impressions of the company in the mind of the new employee.IntroductionThis Employee Handbook (“Handbook”) is a compilation of personnel policies, practices and procedures currently in effect at [Company Name] (“Company”).The Handbook is designed to introduce you to our Company, familiarize you with Company policies, provide general guidelines on work rules, benefits and other issues related to your employment, and help answer many of the questions that may arise in connection with your employment. This Employee Handbook is not a contract of employment, and does not create a contract of employment. Like most American companies, [Company Name] generally does not offer individual employees formal employment contracts with the Company. This Handbook does not create a contract, express or implied, guaranteeing you any specific term of employment, nor does it obligate you to continue your employment for a specific period of time. The purpose of the Handbook is simply to provide you with a convenient explanation of present policies and practices at the Company. This Handbook is an overview or a guideline. It cannot cover every matter that might arise in the workplace. For this reason, specific questions regarding the applicability of a particular policy or practice should be addressed to the Human Resources Department.The Company reserves the right to modify any of our policies and procedures, including those covered in this Handbook, at any time. We will seek to notify you of such changes by email and other appropriate means. However, such a notice is not required for changes to be effective.Employer Note: If you operate in more than one state, or if you are a virtual company with personnel scattered throughout multiple states, you may wish to include the following: We operate in numerous states within the United States. State, local, and federal employment laws change with some frequency, either as a result of a judicial decision or new legislation or regulations. Although we seek to monitor the laws in all states where we have employees, our Handbook may not always reflect the very latest requirements. We are, of course, committed to complying with all applicable laws. If you have specific questions, please contact our Human Resources Department.Part 1 – General Employment Policies and PracticesEqual Employment OpportunityThe Company is an equal opportunity employer. We will extend equal opportunity to all individuals without regard to race, religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity), national origin, disability, age, genetic information, or any other status protected under applicable federal, state, or local laws. Our policy reflects and affirms the Company’s commitment to the principles of fair employment and the elimination of all discriminatory practices. Details of our equal employment opportunity policies are further explained in Part 2.Your Employment Relationship with the CompanyLike most American companies, [Company Name] generally does not offer individual employees a formal employment contract with the Company. Employment is “at will,” meaning that you or the Company may end your employment at any time for any lawful reason.This Employee Handbook is not a contract. It does not create any agreement, express or implied, guaranteeing you any specific terms or conditions of employment. Nothing contained in this Handbook should be construed as creating a contract guaranteeing employment for any specific duration, nor does the Handbook obligate you to continue your employment for a specific period of time. Unless you have entered into an employment agreement that supersedes this document, either you or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time. The Handbook does not guarantee any prescribed process for discipline and discharge.No manager or other representative of the Company, other than the President, has the authority to enter into any agreement guaranteeing employment for any specific period. No such agreement shall be enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the President and the employee.Recruitment and Hiring The Company’s primary goal when recruiting new employees is to fill vacancies with persons who have the best available skills, abilities, or experience needed to perform the work. Decisions regarding the recruitment, selection, and placement of employees are made on the basis of job-related criteria.When positions become available, qualified current employees are encouraged and are welcome to apply for the position. As openings occur, notices relating general information about the position are posted. The manager of the department with the opening will arrange interviews with employees who apply.We encourage current employees to recruit new talent for our Company.Employment ClassificationsThe following terms will be used to describe employment classifications and status:Exempt EmployeesExempt employees are not subject to the overtime pay provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). An exempt employee is one whose specific job duties and salary meet all of the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor’s regulations. In general, an exempt employee is one who is paid on a salary basis at not less than $455 per week who holds an administrative, professional, or management position. Certain outside sales persons and a few other job categories are also exempt.Non-Exempt EmployeesSalaried employees who are not administrative, professional, or managerial employees (as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor) and many hourly employees are generally not exempt from the FLSA’s overtime provisions.Employer Notes: Employers must comply with both federal law and applicable state laws. When federal and state standards are different, the law setting the higher standard (i.e., the one that provides greater protection to employees) must be followed. If you have unionized employees, or if you have both exempt and non-exempt employees, you should have one handbook for each group, i.e., a total of three handbooks. You may use a loose-leaf version so that you can change pages specific to a particular group. We strongly recommend against providing a “one-size-fits-all” handbook to any group of employees, which advises the employees that certain provisions do not apply to them.Full-Time EmployeesFull-time employees are those who are regularly scheduled to work at least [40 hours] per week that are not hired on a temporary basis.Part-Time EmployeesPart-time employees are those who are regularly scheduled to work fewer than [40 hours] per week that are not hired on a temporary basis. Part-time employees are not eligible for Company paid benefits, with the exception of the 401(k) plan, except as required by law. Any employee who works 1,000 hours per year or more may participate in the 401(k) plan.Temporary EmployeesEmployees hired for an interim period of time, usually to fill in for vacations, leaves of absence, or projects of a limited duration. Temporary employees are not eligible for Company paid benefits, except as required by law. Orientation and TrainingTo help you become familiar with the Company and our way of doing things, the Company will provide an orientation and training session within the first few days after you begin work. Some of the content of the session will depend in large part on the nature of your responsibilities, while other parts will be applicable to all employees. In addition, the Company may periodically offer additional training or educational programs. Some programs may be voluntary, while others will be required.Employer Note: This section must, of course, be adapted to your practices. We encourage employers to offer some type of orientation for each employee, which will help the employee to quickly adapt to your company’s culture and practices. For companies sponsoring group health plans that require employees to complete an employment-based orientation period as a condition for eligibility for coverage, such orientation period must not exceed one month in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act’s provisions regarding a 90-day limitation on waiting periods.Immigration Law Applicable to All EmployeesThe Company complies with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 by employing only U.S. citizens and non-citizens who are authorized to work in the United States. All employees are asked on their first day of work to provide original documents verifying the right to work in the United States and to sign a verification form required by federal law (Form I-9). If you cannot verify your right to work in the United States within three (3) days of hire, the Company is required by law to terminate your employment.Hours of WorkThe workweek is generally from [Monday through Friday], with normal operating hours from [8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.], with one hour for lunch.  Employer Note: Exempt employees may or may not have specific times for lunch hours and breaks, since they must by law be paid in full for any day worked. You may wish to schedule a shorter lunch hour, e.g., 30 to 45 minutes. If you have multiple locations, you may wish to add: “Please contact the Human Resources Department for information on normal business office hours at your location.” There are no federal laws requiring specific times for lunch and breaks. You should check with employment counsel or your appropriate state agency to determine whether your state or locality has any special requirements.Flex Time and TelecommutingThe Company recognizes that many employees need flexibility in work schedules in order to meet child care and other needs. Core hours are [9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.] and all employees should be at work during those hours. Within the structure of the core hours, you may schedule your [eight (8) hour] work day as you choose, if the nature of your job permits such flexibility and your supervisor approves your schedule.  The Company also offers employees the opportunity to telecommute. Not all jobs are suitable for telecommuting. You may telecommute up to [three (3) days] per week with the approval of your supervisor.Employer Note: Flex time and telecommuting have become increasingly popular in recent years. In some cases, such flexibility may even increase productivity. If flexible scheduling, telecommuting, or other variations on the traditional workweek are appropriate to your business, describe your policy and practices clearly. If you implement a program, supervisors should not withhold approval of flexible schedules and telecommuting without good reason.OvertimeBecause of the nature of our business, your job may periodically require overtime work. If the Company requires that you work overtime, we will give you as much advance notice as possible.  You should not work overtime hours without prior approval by your immediate supervisor or the designated manager.Employer Notes: Under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, time spent doing work not requested by the employer, but still allowed, is generally “hours worked” entitling employees to compensation, since the employer knows or has reason to believe that the employees are continuing to work and the employer is benefiting from the work being done. Employers should be especially careful when it comes to allowing non-exempt employees to read and respond to work-related emails after hours through the use of smart phones or similar devices. Remember—it is the employer's responsibility to exercise control and see that work it does not want performed is not done. Merely making a rule against “off the clock” work is not enough. The employer has the power to enforce the rule and must make every effort to do so. Although you may voluntarily pay overtime compensation to exempt employees, you are not required to do so under federal law. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay.  Check your state laws as well, as they may impact both overtime compensation and minimum wages. As noted previously, we recommend separate handbooks for exempt and non-exempt employees to eliminate the need to call to employees’ attentions the variables in benefits and policies applicable to different groups of employees. If your company operates on a 24-hour a day, 7-day a week schedule, you may have separate compensation and overtime practices consistent with applicable law. In some instances, e.g., healthcare, an employer may pay overtime for time worked in excess of 80 hours in two weeks rather than 40 hours in one week, subject to employee consent.Attendance and PunctualityIt is important for you to report to work on time and to avoid unnecessary absences. The Company recognizes that illness or other circumstances beyond your control may cause you to be absent from work from time to time. However, frequent absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Excessive absenteeism or frequent tardiness puts an unnecessary strain on your co-workers and can have a negative impact on the success of the Company.You are expected to report to work when scheduled. Whenever you know in advance that you are going to be absent, you should notify your immediate supervisor or the designated manager.  If your absence is unexpected, you should attempt to reach your immediate supervisor as soon as possible, but in no event later than one hour before you are due at work. In the event your immediate supervisor is unavailable, you must speak with a manager. If you must leave a voicemail, you must provide a number where your supervisor may reach you if need be. Some, but not all, absences are compensated under the Company’s leave policies described in Part 5.You are expected to be at your workstation at the beginning of each business day. If you are delayed, you must call your immediate supervisor to state the reason for the delay. As with absences, you must make every effort to speak directly with a manager. Regular delays in reporting to work will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.Inclement WeatherThe Company is open for business unless there is a government-declared state of emergency or unless you are advised otherwise by your supervisor. There may be times when we will delay opening, and on rare occasions, we may have to close. Use common sense and your best judgment when traveling to work in inclement weather. In the event that the Company’s facilities are closed by the Company or the government, employees will be paid for the day. If the Company’s facilities are open and you are delayed getting to work or cannot get to work at all because of inclement weather, the absence will be charged to (1) personal/sick time, (2) vacation time, or (3) unpaid time off, in that order. You should always use your judgment about your own safety in getting to work.  When severe weather develops or is anticipated to develop during the day and a decision is made by the Company to close before [5:30 p.m.], you will be compensated as if you had worked to the end of your regularly scheduled hours for that day. If you elect to leave prior to the time the Company closes, you will be required to use personal/sick time or vacation time in an amount equal to the number of hours between the time you left and the time the office closed.Employer Note: Generally, exempt employees must be paid if they work at all during the week (however, an employer that remains open for business during a period of bad weather may generally make deductions, for full-day absences only, from the salary of an exempt employee who chooses not to report to work because of the weather and performs no work). You may wish to charge non-exempt employees’ sick time or vacation time in the event of tardiness or absence due to inclement weather. We have suggested here that employees be paid if they are unable to work because of a Company decision or government mandate. However, except for rules requiring payment with respect to exempt employees, there is no legal requirement to compensate employees in this manner.Dress Code and Public ImageAs an employee of the Company, we expect you to present a clean and professional appearance when you represent us, whether you are in or outside of the office. You are, therefore, required to dress in appropriate business attire and to behave in a professional, businesslike manner. The current Company dress code is [business-casual]. Please keep in mind, however, that the Company is a professional business office, where clients and others often visit. Generally, clean, neat clothing is acceptable. However, torn jeans or other torn clothing and tee shirts with inappropriate verbiage or pictures are not appropriate casual attire. As always, please use common sense in your choice of business attire.It is the intent of this policy to comply with applicable state, local and federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of color, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity), national origin, disability, age, genetic information and any other status protected under such laws.Employer Note: In some industries, jeans or shorts and tee shirts are the norm, while in others, shirts, ties, and business suits for men and women are the norm. Give careful thought in designing your policy. On the one hand, you want employees to be dressed appropriately, particularly if they interact with customers or clients. On the other hand, too many restrictions may cause unnecessary employee resentment. “Dress-down” or “casual” Fridays are one common option for companies where business attire is normally required.WorkspaceEmployees are responsible for maintaining the workspace assigned to them. A clean, orderly workspace provides an environment conducive to working efficiently. Employees should keep in mind that their workspace is part of a professional environment that portrays the Company’s overall dedication to providing quality service to its clients. Therefore, your workspace should be clean, organized and free of items that are not required to perform your job. Office EquipmentCertain equipment is assigned to staff depending on the needs of the job, such as a calculator, personal computer, printer and access to our central computers and servers. This equipment is the property of the Company and cannot be removed from the office without prior approval from your supervisor. The Company expects that you will treat this equipment with care and report any malfunctions immediately to staff members equipped to diagnose the problem and take corrective action.Personnel RecordsIt is important that the Company maintain accurate personnel records at all times. You are responsible for notifying your immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department of any change in name, home address, telephone number, immigration status, or any other pertinent information. By promptly notifying the Company of such changes, you will avoid compromise of your benefit eligibility, the return of W-2 forms, or similar inconvenience.  Performance Reviews, Salary ReviewsYou will have your first performance review at the end of your first [three (3) months] of employment with the Company. Thereafter, performance reviews will normally be conducted annually on or about your anniversary date. All performance reviews will be completed in writing by your supervisor or manager on the form designated by the Company, and reviewed during a conference with you. Factors considered in your review include the quality of your job performance, your attendance, meeting the requirements of your job description, dependability, attitude, cooperation, compliance with Company employment policies, any disciplinary actions, and year-to-year improvement in overall performance. Compensation increases are given by the Company at its discretion in consideration of various factors, including your performance review.Employer Note: Give careful thought to your means and timing of evaluations. If you promise annual evaluations in the handbook, ensure that all supervisors perform annual evaluations. We cannot stress enough the importance of written evaluations for a variety of reasons, including supporting discipline, discharge, layoff, etc. Be certain that what you say in the handbook is in fact what you actually do in practice.291Internet AccessAccess to the Internet is given principally for work-related activities or approved educational/training activities. Incidental and occasional personal use and study use is permitted. This privilege should not be abused and must not affect the employee’s performance of employment-related activities. Right to MonitorThe Company email and Internet system is at all times the property of the Company. By accessing the Internet, Intranet and electronic mail services through facilities provided by the Company, you acknowledge that the Company (by itself or through its Internet Service Provider) may from time to time monitor, log and gather statistics on employee Internet activity and may examine all individual connections and communications. Please note that the Company uses email filters to block spam and computer viruses. These filters may from time to time block legitimate email messages.Responsibilities and ObligationsEmployees may not access, download or distribute material that is illegal, or which others may find offensive or objectionable, such as material that is pornographic, discriminatory, harassing, or an incitement to violence. You must respect and comply with copyright, trademark and similar laws, and use such protected information in compliance with applicable legal standards. When using web-based sources, you must provide appropriate attribution and citation of information to the websites. Software must not be downloaded from the Internet without the prior approval of qualified persons within the Company. Violation of this Policy In all circumstances, use of Internet access and email systems must be consistent with the law and Company policies. Violation of this policy is a serious offense and, subject to the requirements of the law, may result in a range of sanctions, from restriction of access to electronic communication facilities to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. EmailThe email system is the property of the Company. All emails are archived on the server in accordance with our records retention policy, and all emails are subject to review by the Company. You may make limited use of our email system for matters involving your own personal business, so long as such use is kept to a minimum and does not interfere with your work.The Company email system is Company property, and as such, is subject to monitoring. System monitoring is done for your protection and the protection of the rights or property of the provider of these services. Please consider this when conducting personal business using Company hardware and software. Electronic mail is like any other form of Company communication, and may not be used for harassment or other unlawful purposes. Your email account is a Company-provided privilege, and is Company property. Remember that when you send email from the Company domain, you represent the Company whether your message is business-related or personal.Confidentiality of Electronic MailAs noted above, electronic mail is subject at all times to monitoring, and the release of specific information is subject to applicable laws and Company rules, policies and procedures on confidentiality. Existing rules, policies and procedures governing the sharing of confidential information also apply to the sharing of information via commercial software. Social MediaThe term “social media” includes all means of communicating or posting information or content of any sort on the Internet, including to your own or someone else’s web log or blog, journal or diary, personal website, social networking or affinity website, web bulletin board, or a chat room, whether or not associated or affiliated with the Company, as well as any other form of electronic communication. The same principles and guidelines found in the Company rules, policies and procedures apply to an employee’s social media activities online. Any conduct that adversely affects an employee’s job performance or the performance of fellow employees, or otherwise adversely affects the Company’s legitimate business interests, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Similarly, inappropriate postings, including but not limited to discriminatory remarks, harassment and threats of violence or similar inappropriate or unlawful conduct will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. However, this restriction will not apply to any postings made in the exercise of any rights granted to an employee by federal law.9TelephonesAccess to the Company telephone system is given principally for work-related activities or approved educational/training activities. Incidental and occasional personal use is permitted. This privilege should not be abused and must not affect the employee’s performance of employment-related activities. Telephone usage should be based upon cost-effective practices that support the Company’s mission and should comply with applicable rules and regulations.You should use common sense and your best judgment when making or receiving personal cellular phone calls at work. To the extent possible, employees should make personal cell phone calls during their breaks or lunch times. The use of cameras on cell phones during work hours is prohibited to protect the privacy of the Company as well as of fellow employees. However, this restriction will not apply to any recordings made in the exercise of any rights granted to an employee by federal law.The Company telephone system is at all times the property of the Company. By accessing the telephone system through facilities provided by the Company, you acknowledge that the Company has the right to monitor its telephone system from time to time to ensure that employees are using the system for its intended purposes. The Company prohibits the use of hand-held cellular devices while driving. Employees are strongly encouraged to use a hands-free cellular device while driving, should the use become a necessity in the course of employment. Sending and/or receiving text messages is expressly prohibited while operating any vehicle.Employer Note: You will need a clear policy on the use of company computers, cell phones, fax machines, and other equipment for personal use. Today, there is generally little or no cost to the use of such equipment by employees. Employees may expect to be able to check home email or check news on the Web during the day. You should set forth clearly here what employees are permitted to do and what they are prohibited from doing. This policy is simply one suggestion. If you have no policy or practice, consider creating one that is appropriate for your business and company culture.SmokingIn order to provide a safe and comfortable working environment for all employees, smoking is strictly prohibited at all times inside any Company building.Employer Note: Please check your state laws to determine if there is a no-smoking law for the workplace and whether the law includes electronic smoking devices (“e-cigarettes”). If there is, you may use the following in your handbook: “In compliance with state law and in order to provide a safe and comfortable working environment for all employees, smoking (including the use of electronic smoking devices) is strictly prohibited at all times inside any Company building.”Drug-Free WorkplaceThe Company takes the problem of drug and alcohol abuse seriously, and is committed to providing a substance abuse-free workplace for its employees. Substance abuse of any kind is inconsistent with the behavior expected of our employees, subjects all employees and visitors to our facilities to unacceptable safety risks, and undermines our ability to operate effectively and efficiently. The Company has adopted a formal policy related to substance abuse. A copy of the complete policy is contained in this Handbook. Employer Note: Your complete policy, if any, including any provisions for random or reasonable cause-based testing should be set forth in the handbook. To help build your own company drug-free workplace policy, please click here.Substance AbuseThe Company recognizes alcohol and drug abuse as potential health, safety and security problems. The Company expects all employees to assist in maintaining a work environment free from the effects of alcohol, drugs or other intoxicating substances. Compliance with this substance abuse policy is made a condition of employment, and violations of the policy may lead to discipline and/or discharge.All employees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, possession, use, distribution or purchase of illicit drugs, alcohol or other intoxicants, as well as the misuse of prescription drugs on Company premises or at any time and any place during working hours. While we cannot control your behavior off the premises on your own time, we certainly encourage you to behave responsibly and appropriately at all times. All employees are required to report to their jobs in appropriate mental and physical condition, ready to work. Substance abuse is an illness that can be treated. Employees who have an alcohol or drug abuse problem are encouraged to seek appropriate professional assistance. You may inform your immediate supervisor, designated manager, or Human Resources for assistance in seeking help to address substance abuse, who can also help you determine coverage available under the Company’s medical insurance plan.  When work performance is impaired, admission to or use of a treatment or other program does not preclude appropriate action by the Company.Any violator of this substance abuse policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.Employer Notes: Some states provide discounts in workers’ compensation premiums to employers that implement drug-free workplace policies. Check with legal counsel or state authorities to determine whether your state provides such discounts, as well as to determine any state law governing drugs in the workplace. With respect to drug testing, state or local law may mandate a particular protocol or procedure in order to protect employees against false positives and careless handling of blood and urine samples, as well as to protect employees’ privacy. Before implementing any drug testing program, check to determine whether your jurisdiction has any directives affecting your testing and the results of the testing. In addition, certain states prevent employers from denying an applicant a position based upon a positive test for marijuana, so employers should be sure that any drug testing protocol reflects the most recent developments to state or local law in this area. Employee substance abuse costs employers billions of dollars annually. It is, however, an illness that can be treated. You may wish to provide that the company will provide support to employees who reveal their addiction and seek help, and such employees will not be subject to discipline, whereas if their addiction is discovered as a result of misuse of drugs or alcohol at work, there will be no such clemency. If you have an employee assistance program (EAP), employees should be referred to that program rather than to the HR Department. Confidentiality is critical for employees to be willing to seek help.Safety and Accident RulesSafety is a joint venture at the Company. We strive to provide a clean, hazard-free, healthy, safe environment in which to work, and we make every effort to comply with all relevant federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act. As an employee, you have a duty to comply with the safety rules of the Company, and you are expected to take an active part in maintaining this hazard-free environment. You must observe all posted safety rules, adhere to all safety instructions provided by your supervisor, and use safety equipment where required. Your workspace should be kept neat, clean and orderly. You are required to report any accidents or injuries – including any breaches of safety – and to promptly report any unsafe equipment, working condition, process or procedure to a supervisor. In addition, if you become ill or get injured while at work, you must notify your manager immediately. Failure to do so may result in a loss of benefits under the state workers’ compensation law. Failure to abide by the Company’s safety and accident rules may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Workplace Violence Prevention PolicyAs stated above, the Company is committed to the safety and security of our employees. Workplace violence presents a serious occupational safety hazard to our organization, staff, and clients.Workplace violence includes any physical assault or act of aggressive behavior occurring where an employee performs any work-related duty in the course of his or her employment, including but not limited to an attempt or threat, whether verbal or physical, to inflict physical injury upon an employee; any intentional display of force which would give an employee reason to fear or expect bodily harm; intentional and wrongful physical contact with a person without his or her consent that entails some injury; or stalking an employee with the intent of causing fear of material harm to the physical safety and health of such employee when such stalking has arisen through and in the course of employment.Acts of violence by or against any of our employees where any work-related duty is performed will be thoroughly investigated and appropriate action will be taken, including involving law enforcement authorities when warranted. All employees are responsible for helping to create an environment of mutual respect for each other as well as clients and visitors, following all policies, procedures and practices, and for assisting in maintaining a safe and secure work environment.Promotions and TransfersIn an effort to match you with the job for which you are most suited and/or to meet the business and operational needs of the Company, you may be transferred from your current job. This may be either at your request or as a result of a decision by the Company.Reasons for transfer may include, but are not necessarily limited to, fluctuations in department workloads or production flow; a desire for more efficient utilization of personnel; increased career opportunities; personality conflicts; health; other personal situations; or other business reasons.Most job openings that are intended to be filled from within the Company will be posted on the [Insert where postings occur, e.g., company intranet, bulletin board, newsletter]. The management of the Company does reserve the right, however, to transfer or promote an employee without posting the availability of that position. Temporary transfers may be made at the discretion of the Company management.You are eligible to request a transfer and to be considered for promotions upon completion of [six (6) months] of satisfactory performance in your current job. Your eligibility is also dependent, of course, on your having the needed skills, education, experience and other qualifications that are required for the job. However, a transfer may take place within the first [six (6) months] of employment if the management of the Company believes that it is in the best interest of the Company to make an exception to this guideline.Part 2 – Anti-Discrimination & Harassment Employer Note: Every employer must determine the specifics of applicable state and local law, which are often more stringent than federal law. For example, discrimination may be prohibited based upon personal appearance, family responsibilities, matriculation, or political affiliation. Employers are strongly encouraged to prohibit any kind of discrimination. Note that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act apply to employers of 15 or more employees in 20 or more weeks of the calendar year. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act applies to employers with 20 or more employees. Some states also have similar statutes prohibiting discrimination that apply to smaller employers. Affirmative Action: Employers who are government contractors may be subject to Executive Order 11246, Executive Order 13665, Directive 307, and other federal laws which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, and require that employers take steps to ensure equal employment opportunity in the workplace. If you are subject to these laws, add: “The Company has developed affirmative action plans for minorities and women, individuals with disabilities, and Vietnam-era or special disabled veterans. These plans, or relevant portions of them, are available for your inspection upon request.”Discrimination Is ProhibitedThe Company is an equal opportunity employer and makes all employment decisions without regard to race, religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity), national origin, disability, age, genetic information, or any other status protected under applicable federal, state, or local laws. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, benefits, compensation and training. We seek to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws related to discrimination and will not tolerate the interference with the ability of any of the Company’s employees to perform their job duties. The Company makes decisions concerning employment based strictly on an individual’s qualifications and ability to perform the job under consideration, the comparative qualifications and abilities of other applicants or employees, and the individual’s past performance within the organization. If you believe that an employment decision has been made that does not conform with management’s commitment to equal opportunity, you should promptly bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor, designated manager, or Human Resources. Your complaint will be promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated. There will be no retaliation against any employee who files a complaint in good faith, even if the result of the investigation produces insufficient evidence to support the complaint.Americans with Disabilities ActThe federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, fringe benefits, job training, and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. The ADA does not alter the Company’s right to hire the best-qualified applicant, but it does prohibit discrimination against a qualified applicant or employee because of his or her disability, or because of a perceived disability. As a matter of Company policy, the Company prohibits discrimination of any kind against people with disabilities.   Disabled DefinedAn applicant or employee is considered disabled if he or she (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record or past history of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded or perceived (correctly or incorrectly) as having such impairment.A qualified employee or applicant with a disability is an individual who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the position held or desired, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position.Reasonable AccommodationA reasonable accommodation is any change in the work environment (or in the way things are usually done) to help a person with a disability apply for a job, perform the duties of a job, or enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment. Qualified applicants or employees who are disabled should request reasonable accommodation from the Company in order to allow them to perform a particular job. If you are disabled and you desire such reasonable accommodation, contact your immediate supervisor, designated manager, or Human Resources. On receipt of your request we will meet with you to discuss your disability. We may ask for information from your health care provider(s) regarding the nature of your disability and the nature of your limitations, or take other steps necessary to help us determine viable options for reasonable accommodation. We will then work with you to determine whether your disability can be reasonably accommodated, and if it can be accommodated, we will explore alternatives with you and endeavor to implement a mutually agreeable accommodation.  Reasonable accommodation may take many forms and it will vary from one employee to another. Please note that according to the ADA, the Company does not have to provide the exact accommodation you want, and if more than one accommodation works, we may choose which one to provide. Furthermore, the Company does not have to provide an accommodation if doing so would cause undue hardship to the Company.Workplace HarassmentThe Company is committed to providing a work environment that provides employees equality, respect and dignity. In keeping with this commitment, the Company has adopted a policy of “zero tolerance” with regard to employee harassment. Harassment is defined under federal law as unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. Harassment becomes unlawful where: (1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment; or (2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.  This policy applies to all aspects of your employment. Harassment of any other person, including, without limitation, fellow employees, contractors, visitors, clients or customers, whether at work or outside of work, is grounds for immediate termination. The Company will make every reasonable effort to ensure that its entire community is familiar with this policy and that all employees are aware that every complaint received will be promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated, and resolved appropriately. The Company will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who complains of harassment or who participates in an investigation. Sexual HarassmentSexual harassment is prohibited by federal, state and local laws, and applies equally to men and women. Federal law defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when the conduct: (1) explicitly or implicitly affects a term or condition of an employee’s employment; (2) is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or (3) unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Such conduct may include, but is not limited to: subtle or overt pressure for sexual favors; inappropriate touching; lewd, sexually oriented comments or jokes; foul or obscene language; posting of suggestive or sexually explicit posters, calendars, photographs, graffiti, or cartoons; and repeated requests for dates. Company policy further prohibits harassment and discrimination based on sex stereotyping. (Sex stereotyping occurs when one person perceives a man to be unduly effeminate or a woman to be unduly masculine and harasses or discriminates against that person because he or she does not fit the stereotype of being male or female.) The Company encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of sexual harassment, regardless of who the offender may be. Every employee is encouraged to raise any questions or concerns with his or her immediate supervisor, designated manager, or Human Resources.Employer Note—Harassment: It is critically important for every employer to have a well-crafted anti-harassment policy which both implements a zero-tolerance policy regarding harassment and provides an effective means for employees to report harassment without fear of retaliation. Employers may be liable for harassment by supervisors and fellow employees. In some cases, an employer can be liable for harassment from outside parties like customers. Employers are required to exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment. The existence of a well-crafted, effective policy is evidence of that reasonable care. If an employee alleges sexual harassment, the existence of the policy will, in many cases, provide a basis of an affirmative defense against the allegation.Supervisors’ Responsibilities All managers are expected to ensure that the work environment is free from sexual and other harassment. They are responsible for the application and communication of this policy within their work areas. Managers should: Encourage employees to report any violations of this policy before the harassment becomes severe or pervasive.Make sure the Human Resources Department is made aware of any inappropriate behavior in the workplace.Create a work environment where sexual and other harassment is not permitted.Procedures for Reporting and Investigating Harassment Employees should report incidents of inappropriate behavior or sexual harassment as soon as possible after the occurrence. Employees who believe they have been harassed, regardless of whether the offensive act was committed by a manager, co-worker, vendor, visitor, or client, should promptly notify their immediate supervisor, designated manager, or Human Resources. If the employee’s immediate supervisor is involved in the incident, the employee should report the incident to the Human Resources Department. The Company takes claims of harassment seriously, no matter how trivial a claim may appear. All complaints of harassment, sexual harassment, or other inappropriate sexual conduct will be promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated by the Company.The Company prohibits retaliation against any employee who files or pursues a harassment claim. To the extent possible, all complaints and related information will remain confidential, except to those individuals who need the information to investigate, educate, or take action in response to the complaint. All employees are expected to cooperate fully with any ongoing investigation regarding a harassment incident. Employees who believe they have been unjustly charged with harassment can defend themselves verbally or in writing at any stage of the investigation. To protect the privacy of persons involved, confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the extent practicable and appropriate under the circumstances. Investigations may include interviews with the parties involved, and, where necessary, individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or who may have relevant knowledge.At the conclusion of a harassment investigation, the complainant and the alleged “harasser” will be informed of the determination. Where appropriate, the “harasser” and the “victim” may be offered mediation or counseling through an employee assistance program (EAP). Penalties for Violation of Anti-Harassment Policy If it is determined that inappropriate conduct has occurred, the Company will act promptly to eliminate the offending conduct, and take such action as is appropriate under the circumstances.  Such action may range from counseling to termination of employment, and may include such other forms of disciplinary action (such as, for example, suspension), as the Company deems appropriate under the circumstances and in accordance with applicable law.Part 3 – CompensationPayroll PracticesEmployees are paid [semi-monthly], on or about [the 15th and the 30th of each month]. If the regularly scheduled payroll date falls on a Saturday, the Company will attempt to deliver paychecks on Friday. If the regular payday falls on a Sunday, employees will be paid on Monday. When a payroll date falls on a holiday, employees will, when possible, be paid on the last business day before the holiday. Otherwise, employees will be paid on the first business day following the scheduled payroll date.Employer Note: State payday requirements vary. While employers are generally permitted to pay more frequently than the minimum requirements, employers should ensure that any payroll policy or practice complies with applicable state law governing how and when employees are to be paid.Salary Deductions and WithholdingThe Company will withhold the following from your paycheck: TaxesFederal, state and local taxes, as required by law, as well as the required FICA (Social Security and Medicare) payments.InsuranceYour contribution to health insurance or other insurance premiums for yourself and any eligible family members or to other contributory benefit programs.Other DeductionsOther deductions which you authorize, including [short-term disability insurance, flexible spending account (FSA) contributions, and 401(k) contributions]. Direct DepositYou may have your paycheck deposited directly into your bank account. You will be given the authorization form for deposit by your immediate supervisor, designated manager, or Human Resources.Part 4 – Benefits GeneralThis section describes the benefits provided by the Company and information on your eligibility for benefits. Details regarding each benefit plan are contained in the Company’s Benefit Booklet. Benefit plans governed by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) may be further described in formal summary plan descriptions or other legal documents, which are available for your review in the Human Resources Department. Full-time employees are eligible to participate in the various insurance programs offered by the Company on their first day of employment. Periodically there will be an Open Enrollment period (described below). If you decline to participate in these programs on your initial eligibility date, you may request entry into the plan during Open Enrollment or Special Enrollment (described below).Medical InsuranceThe Company offers medical insurance to all full-time employees. Employees may choose from several plans. Details of the plans may be found in the benefit booklets. This Handbook does not constitute such a legal document. The Company offers medical and dental coverage for eligible employees and their eligible dependents. These programs are administered by a major medical insurance carrier or health maintenance organization (HMO). An employee contribution for coverage will be deducted from your salary based on your benefit selections. Your Summary Plan Description (SPD) contains more details about these plans. For more details, please refer to the specific SPD that governs each of the plans. In the event of any conflict between the information contained in this Handbook and in the Company’s SPDs, the SPDs shall govern. These plans are subject to change at the Company’s discretion. Additionally, the amount that you may be required to contribute towards the premiums for any of these plans may be changed at the Company’s discretion.Employee ContributionsThe Company’s benefit package is contributory; that is, you are responsible for a portion of the premium for your benefits. A portion of the premium, up to a maximum per month, is contributed by the Company. Your contributory cost is deducted from your paycheck. Open EnrollmentAt the time you are hired, you are given an opportunity to elect certain benefits. If you waive participation in any of these programs for either yourself or your eligible dependents, you will generally be allowed to apply for entry into the various plans only during Open Enrollment. The Open Enrollment period allows employees to add to or change their benefits coverage. Applications for [medical, dental, short-term disability (STD), long-term disability (LTD), life insurance and supplemental life insurance] may be submitted during this period. Changes, additions and other elections made during Open Enrollment will take effect on the effective date following the Open Enrollment period. Once you have made a change, you generally cannot change that selection until the next Open Enrollment period (except in the case of certain life events; see Special Enrollment). Special EnrollmentSpecial enrollment allows individuals who previously declined coverage to enroll in the plan upon loss of eligibility for other coverage and upon certain life events, such as marriage and the birth, adoption, or placement for adoption of a child. Employees must generally request enrollment within 30 days of the loss of coverage or life event triggering the special enrollment. For specific details regarding special enrollment, please refer to your Summary Plan Description. Continuation of Health CoverageFederal law generally requires employers with 20 or more employees to give employees, spouses and dependent children the right to continue group health benefits for limited periods of time under certain circumstances, such as voluntary or some types of involuntary job loss, reduction in hours worked, death, divorce and other life events. Employees ordinarily may continue their health coverage for up to 18 months when their employment is terminated.Employer Note: Many states have their own continuation of coverage laws (""mini-COBRA"") which apply to employers of fewer than 20 employees and/or extend required periods of continuation coverage provided under federal law. Be sure to comply with your state’s laws on continuation of coverage in addition to the federal COBRA law.Dental InsuranceThe Company offers a dental plan for eligible employees. Please refer to the dental Summary Plan Description for an explanation of the plan benefits and limitations.Short-Term Disability Plan (STD)A short-term disability plan is provided for eligible full-time employees. Please refer to the STD Summary Plan Description for an explanation of the plan benefits and limitations.Employer Note: Five states require employers to provide temporary disability benefits for employees. These states require employers to provide a minimum amount of short-term disability benefits to employees while they are prevented from working due to an off-the-job injury or illness. Some states permit insurance companies to provide the coverage; others insist that all coverage be provided by the state and paid for through payroll taxes. Each state’s plan and administration is handled differently, including eligibility requirements, benefit amounts, and the duration of benefits. The following states require some form of a disability plan: California Hawaii New Jersey New York Rhode Island Accordingly, be sure to comply with your state’s short-term disability laws.Long-Term Disability Plan (LTD)Long-term disability coverage is a voluntary benefit that may be made available to employees. This benefit would pay a portion of your regular salary for an extended period of time. LTD is employee-specific. If you elect this type of coverage, please refer to the LTD Summary Plan Description for an explanation of the plan benefits and limitations.Life InsuranceFull-time employees are eligible for and are automatically enrolled in a group term life insurance program. Enrollees may designate or change the beneficiary for this policy at any time. The Company pays the premium for this program. The face value of this benefit is equal to one times the employee’s annual salary. For details, please refer to the plan SPD. Supplemental Life InsuranceFull-time employees are eligible to purchase supplemental life insurance for themselves at group rates. Supplemental life insurance is a voluntary benefit and is employee-specific. Enrollees should refer to the plan SPD for eligibility requirements, plan limitations, and additional information.Workers’ Compensation Insurance To provide for payment of your medical expenses and for partial salary continuation in the event of a work-related accident or illness, you are covered by workers’ compensation insurance, provided by the Company and based on state regulations. The amount of benefits payable, as well as the duration of payments, depends upon the nature of your injury or illness. However, all medical expenses incurred in connection with an on-the-job injury or illness and partial salary payments are paid in accordance with applicable state law. If you are injured or become ill on the job, you must immediately report the injury or illness to your manager and the Human Resources Department. This ensures that the Company can help you obtain appropriate medical treatment. Your failure to follow this procedure may delay your benefits or may even jeopardize your receipt of benefits. Questions regarding workers’ compensation insurance should be directed to the Human Resources Department.TravelDetails of the Company’s Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy are contained in the appendix to this Handbook.Part 5 – Holidays, Vacation and Other LeaveReligious ObservanceFederal and state equal opportunity laws generally require employers to accommodate the religious beliefs of employees, but do not require them to provide paid leave. The Company respects your religious beliefs, however, and therefore, will provide [one (1) day] of paid leave to employees who, for religious reasons, must be away from the office on days of normal operation. Employees who require additional time off may use vacation and/or personal days. This leave must be requested through the department manager two weeks prior to the event.Employer Note: Federal law and the laws of many states require an employer to make “reasonable accommodation” for the religious practices of employees, and prohibit any form of discrimination based upon religion. It is often helpful to grant an additional day or two that employees may take for religious observance, e.g., Jewish High Holy Days.VacationThe Company recognizes the importance of vacation time in providing rest, recreation and personal enrichment. Vacations are established on a calendar-year basis. Full-time employees earn vacation time as follows:	[1st year of employment  				Two (2) weeks 	2nd through 5th year of employment			Twelve (12) days	6th through 15th year of employment			Three (3) weeks	16th year of employment and following		Four (4) weeks]Part-time employees earn vacation on a pro-rata basis. For example, an employee who works 30 hours per week will earn ¾ of the amount of vacation a full-time employee earns, while an employee working one-half time earns one-half the vacation of a full-time employee.Accrual and CarryoverEmployees begin to accrue vacation time when they begin work for the Company. Employees may use their vacation at any time after the first [90 days] of employment. Employees may generally carry over vacation days from one year to the next. However, to encourage employees to use vacation, there is a cap on the amount of vacation that can be accumulated. Vacation accrual is capped at one and one-half times (1 ½) an employee’s annual vacation accrual rate. Once the cap is reached, an employee will not be able to accumulate any more vacation until some of it is used and drops below the cap. After vacation goes below the cap, employees can begin accruing vacation again.    ProcedureYou should submit requests for vacation time to your supervisor as soon as you know when you wish to schedule your vacation, but in no event less than two weeks prior to the time requested. Vacation requests are approved by your immediate supervisor. Vacation time is coordinated so that sufficient staff is available to provide adequate coverage at all times, and there may be Company-wide or department-specific “blackout dates,” as necessary. Vacation requests are granted on a first-come, first-served basis. In the event of a conflict in vacation requests, your supervisor will consider the Company’s staffing needs during the relevant period, as well as the length of service with the Company of the employees involved.Vacation Options: There are innumerable variables regarding vacation. You may wish to specify that employees earn so many hours or days of vacation each month or each pay period, and prohibit use of vacation not yet accrued. The vacation time suggested here is a minimum. There is much to be said for giving employees three to four weeks of vacation early on in their job tenure, allowing them to go perhaps as high as six weeks if they are with you for many years. It is common for managers to earn more vacation than non-managerial employees. In fact, managers may often be able to negotiate variations in vacation time at the time of hire. It is wise to address benefits unique to managers in a separate handbook or in a supplement to this one. Some employers prefer to give employees a specified number of days annually to use for vacation, illness, personal needs, etc. Such a policy may reduce employee abuse of sick leave.  The downside of such a policy, however, is that sick employees may come to work in order to avoid losing vacation time and infect other employees. Similarly, an employee who suffers a serious injury or illness may have no time left for vacation.Holiday Pay Employees are entitled to the following paid holidays:	New Year’s Day	Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. Washington’s Birthday	Memorial Day	Independence DayLabor Day[Columbus Day][Veterans Day]Thanksgiving Day[Day after Thanksgiving]	Christmas DayPersonal LeavePersonal leave may be used for the following:Medical and dental appointments for yourself or family members;Your personal illness, or that of a member of your family; orPersonal business that cannot be tended to outside of work hours, e.g., a house closing.You are not required to give any specific reason for using your personal/sick time. However, when you do take personal/sick time you should give your immediate supervisor as much advance notice as possible.You will accrue four [(4) hours] of personal leave each month, up to a total of [six (6) days] per 12-month period. You may carry over personal leave from year to year and accumulate a maximum of [480 hours of leave] for full-time employees and [240 hours] for part-time employees. Employer Note: Determining how much leave to provide employees is always a challenge. On the one hand, if employees have too much leave, some employees may abuse it. Excessive absenteeism creates myriad problems for an employer. On the other hand, it is generally in the employer’s best interest that employees who are ill stay home. There are also times when employees have to have time to take care of personal business. The other major consideration is whether to allow accrual and if so, how much. If you have a short-term disability plan, then the parameters of the plan may dictate leave accrual. Employees need only accumulate leave to cover the period before the plan becomes effective if they are disabled. On the other hand, absent a plan, allowing employees to accrue enough leave to be paid during FMLA leave has many attributes. A total of 480 hours is suggested as this is the total leave for a 40 hour per week employee for 12 weeks of FMLA. In addition, many states require private employers to provide a certain amount of sick leave, either with or without pay, to their employees. In some states and even in some cities, employees must meet specific requirements (such as satisfying certain notification procedures) in order to obtain such leave. As a result, employers in certain instances may be required to comply with only the federal law, only the state law, or both. If there is any question as to which law applies to a particular employer or situation, the employer should contact a knowledgeable employment law attorney or contact their state labor department for specific guidance.Notification ProceduresWhen you are absent from work and your absence has not been previously scheduled, you must personally notify your immediate supervisor or manager as soon as you are aware that you will be late or unable to report to work. Leaving a voicemail or message with another staff member does not qualify as notifying your supervisor.When absence is due to illness, the Company reserves the right to require appropriate medical documentation. Such documentation includes the employee’s name, the date and time the employee was seen, and if applicable, a specific instruction regarding the employee’s incapacity to perform his or her job. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness can result in discipline, up to and including discharge. (Also see the section on Family & Medical Leave for extended leave situations.)If you are absent because of an accident or you are absent for longer than seven (7) days due to illness, compensation is paid under the benefits of the Company’s short-term disability plan, provided you are eligible for and participate in that plan.Bereavement LeaveEmployees will receive up to [three (3) days] of paid time off in the event of the death of a member of their immediate family. Immediate family includes spouses, domestic partners, children, parents, parents-in-law, brothers or sisters, and brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law. You are allowed [one (1) day] of paid leave in the event of the death of an extended family member. Extended family includes grandparents, aunts and uncles, and other more distant relatives.Military Service LeaveEmployees serving in the uniformed services, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and Public Health Service commissioned corps, as well as the reserve components of each of these services, may take unpaid military leave, as needed, to enable them to fulfill their obligations as servicemembers. Servicemembers must provide advance written or verbal notice to the Company for all military duty, unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity. Employees should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. In addition, employees may, but are not required to, use accrued vacation or personal leave while performing military duty.Family and Medical LeaveThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows certain employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for the serious health condition of the employee or an immediate family member, or for childbirth or adoption. An employee who assumes the role of caring for a child is also entitled to receive parental rights to family leave, regardless of the legal or biological relationship. Either day-to-day care or financial support may establish a parental relationship when the employee intends to assume the responsibilities of a parent with regard to a child. The Human Resources Department will guide you in completing appropriate forms for the leave. Any paid leave that you have accrued may be counted as part of your FMLA leave. To take FMLA leave, you must provide the Company with appropriate notice. If you know in advance that you will need FMLA leave, you must notify your supervisor or the HR Department at least 30 days in advance. If you learn of your need for leave less than 30 days in advance, you must give notice as soon as you can (generally either the day you learn of the need or the next work day). When you need FMLA leave unexpectedly (for example, if a family member is injured in an accident), you must inform your supervisor or the HR Department as soon as you can.   Military Caregiver LeaveThe FMLA also allows an eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a member of the Armed Forces, National Guard or Reserves or of certain recent veterans with a serious illness or injury, up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period to care for the injured or ill servicemember or veteran. A “serious illness or injury” is generally an injury or illness incurred by the covered servicemember in the line of duty on active duty (or that existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty) that may render the servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or rating. An eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave and leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason in a single 12-month period, provided that the employee may not take more than 12 weeks of leave for any other FMLA-qualifying reason during this period. (For example, in the single 12-month period an employee could take 12 weeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child and 14 weeks of military caregiver leave, but could not take 16 weeks of leave to care for a newborn child and 10 weeks of military caregiver leave.) Generally, you must give the Company at least 30 days’ notice before the commencement of any military caregiver leave.Qualifying (Military) Exigency LeaveThe FMLA also provides for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period when an eligible employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on (or has been notified of an impending call to) “covered active duty” in the Armed Forces. (“Covered active duty” for members of a regular component of the Armed Forces means duty during deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country. “Covered active duty” for members of the U.S. National Guard and Reserves means duty during deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to active duty in a contingency operation.) The leave may also be extended to the family members of certain retired military. This leave may be used to take care of such things as child care or financial and legal arrangements necessitated by the deployment of the family member. Break Time for Nursing MothersThe federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) allows employees to take reasonable, unpaid break time to express breast milk as needed for up to one (1) year after the birth of a child. The Company will provide a place for the employee to express breast milk, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public. Employees will not be discharged or in any other manner discriminated against in exercising their rights under this policy. Employer Note: State laws may provide greater protections to nursing mothers (for example, by providing compensated break time or by providing break time beyond one year after the child’s birth). Be sure to check your state law or consult with knowledgeable employment counsel to determine your obligations.Civic Duty Leave Jury DutyThe Company encourages employees to fulfill their civic duties. To that end, employees will be allowed leave to serve on a jury, if summoned. We request that you give us a copy of your summons notice as soon as you receive it, so that we may keep it on file. If you are called during a particularly busy period, we may ask you to request a postponement. The Company will provide additional documentation in this regard, if necessary, to obtain such postponement.Jury duty can last from a portion of a single day to several months or more. During this time you will be considered on a leave of absence and will be entitled to continue to participate in insurance and other benefits as if you were working. While serving on jury duty, you are expected to call in to your supervisor periodically to keep him or her apprised of your status. The Company will compensate full-time employees for the difference between jury duty compensation and your current daily pay for the first [five (5) days] of jury service (or in accordance with applicable law, if different). If additional time is required, it will be granted, but without pay. Employer Notes: Most states require employers to allow employees to take jury duty leave without being terminated, and some states require paid leave. Be sure to review your state’s jury duty leave law for applicable requirements. Remember that an employer generally cannot make deductions for absences of an exempt employee due to jury duty or serving as a witness, but may offset any amount received by an exempt employee as jury or witness fees for a particular week against the salary due for that particular week. The employee need not be paid for any workweek during which he or she performs no work.Appearance as a WitnessAn employee called to appear as a witness will be permitted time off to appear, but without pay. Employees will be permitted to use accrued vacation time when appearing as witnesses.VotingThe Company encourages all employees to vote. Most polling facilities for elections for public office have hours that are scheduled to accommodate working voters. The Company, therefore, requests that employees schedule their voting for before or after their work shifts. An employee who expects a conflict, however, should notify his or her supervisor, in advance, so that schedules can be adjusted if necessary. 38Part 6 – MiscellaneousLeaving the CompanyIf you wish to resign your employment with the Company, we request that you notify your manager of your anticipated departure date at least two (2) weeks in advance. This notice should be in the form of a written note or letter.  You will be paid for accrued but unused vacation time as part of your last paycheck. The Company asks all employees to participate in an exit interview with their immediate supervisor prior to leaving the Company. This provides an opportunity to return parking passes, keys and other property and to tie up any loose ends. You will receive preliminary information at that time regarding continuation coverage and any other continuation of benefits for which you may be eligible.If you leave the Company in good standing, you may be considered for reemployment at a later date. However, in the case of rehiring, the Company may consider you to be a new employee with respect to vacation time, benefits and seniority.Dispute ResolutionIn a perfect world, every employment relationship would be smooth and harmonious. However, there are, unfortunately, times when employees and employers disagree. These disagreements often arise in the context of involuntary employment termination, but there may be disagreements regarding the right to a promotion, expense reimbursement, or on other matters. All employees of the Company agree to first seek to mediate any dispute with the Company with a mediator from the American Arbitration Association or similar organization trained and experienced in employment disputes. If mediation is not successful, both the Company and the employee agree to submit their dispute to arbitration. The arbitrator will be chosen from a panel presented by the American Arbitration Association or such other organization as is acceptable to both parties. The cost of the arbitrator will be split between the Company and the employee.  Each party will be responsible for its own attorney or other related fees. Both the Company and the employee acknowledge that by agreeing to arbitrate, each gives up its right to litigate their employment dispute in court or to submit it to a jury. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding.However, either party may seek to have a court of competent jurisdiction enforce an arbitration award. In addition, the Company retains the right to seek injunctive or other relief in the case of misappropriation of trade secrets or other confidential information, or any other action by an employee which might reasonably be expected to lead to irreparable harm to the Company.© 2009–2018 HR 360, Inc."

56,documents/Technology-Internet-Opt-Out.pdf,hr,good,"Technology/Internet Opt-Out FormRidgefield School District (the District) recognizes that our students must be prepared to live and work in a digital world. In order to facilitate this, the District utilizes a variety of technology to provide students with tools to help them develop research, collaboration, fluency and other technology skills. In order to provide these sorts of opportunities the District operates a networked infrastructure that includes access to local (in-District) resources as well as the Internet, student email, and online educational resources. The District has determined that access to these resources is necessary to provide the type of education that gives its students the best chance to be successful in work and life. The responsible use of these resources are outlined in the School Board Procedure 2022P.Accounts and applications that are part of daily student use include but are not limited to:Active Directory: All students are provided with an Active Directory account that allows them to log onto District devices in order to access networked services. In addition, each student is given space on a file storage system to save their work. Active Directory accounts also allow the District to grant or limit access to resources both within the district and to Internet-based applications.Ridgefield School District’s G Suite (Google Apps for Education) Environment: This education-focused G-Suite environment is hosted by Google, and managed by the District. This collection of online applications provides students with a Google email account, calendar, and access to Google Drive, where students can create, share, and publish documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and other artifacts of their learning. The District creates and manages user accounts; manages access to applications and email based on grade level organizations; and manages permissions. Student email is generally limited to sending and receiving messages within the District Google domain. In cases where outside communication is warranted, it is tightly controlled to include only necessary outside email users or domains. Online Curriculum Systems: Many recently adopted curricula are fully online or include a component of online content. In many cases these require individual user accounts. The District creates these accounts and does not provide any information that does not conform with FERPA or other privacy directives. District teaching staff also utilize YouTube videos in their classrooms. However, YouTube content is restricted teacher-approved or educational content. Other online resources where students will participate is reviewed by the District to ensure that it adheres to privacy laws and does not contain objectionable content.Assessments: The District utilizes an online assessment system several times per year to assess student progress. This system is Web-based, thus requiring students to use computing devices to take the assessments. In addition, much of the state-mandated annual testing is completely online as well. Students must use District computing devices to participate.Under the Federal Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), the District is required to filter Internet access and to teach online safety. The District takes your student’s safety and privacy very seriously and makes every effort to supervise and monitor student technology use. We use Internet filtering software to block access to content that is obscene, pornographic, and harmful to minors. We provide instruction to all students in the area of Digital Citizenship through use of District-approved curriculum.Page 1 of 2Parents or guardians have the right to terminate their student’s access to electronic tools and resources by signing this Opt-Out form. If you do not want your student to use District technology resources, please be aware that your decision to eliminate access to these tools may significantly affect your student’s ability to work collaboratively with his or her peers on class assignments and project, and may impact the development of skills necessary to live and work in this increasingly digital world.This Opt-Out request will remain in effect for one school year, and expires at the end of this school year. A parent or guardian must complete a new Opt-Out form every school year. If no documentation is on file, it will be assumed that permission has been granted for access to the Internet, Google Apps for Education, Online Curriculum services, and other online applications and services that have been selected for use by the District, your child’s school, or your child’s teacher.Please initial each of the following statements, complete the other information below, and sign and return this form to the main office at your student’s school.

58,documents/IT-policy.pdf,hr,good,"Internet and Technology Safety Policy Agreement FormOur school has computers in every classroom, in the library, and in our computer labs. All of the computers are connected to the Internet. We are aware that there are things on the Internet that are neither useful nor appropriate for children. Because of that, an adult will always monitor students during computer use.The Internet contains a wealth of educational information for students. More and more educational resources (encyclopedias, reference tools, magazine and newspaper databases, and educational software) are Internet based. We hope to teach our students critical information skills including how to make good judgments regarding the wealth of information that is available. Please read the Internet and Technology Safety Policy for Students which governs the use of the computers and the Internet at ALCS. A parent or guardian signature is required before students will be allowed to independently use the computers for Internet access.INTERNET AND TECHNOLOGY SAFETY POLICY FOR STUDENTSInternet access will be provided for students for the purpose of instructing, accessing information, conducting research, and communicating with others as part of a specific curriculum. Remember: communication on the Internet is often very public in nature.

Any service that is duplicative of a service already requested or being used by the applicant will not be eligible. Training is only eligible for eligible products or services and for eligible users10            Special Eligibility ConditionsThis section contains information on the following: Ancillary use, Cost Allocation, Eligible Users and Locations, Internet Access with Ineligible Features, Leased Wide Area Network (WAN) Infrastructure, the Two-in-Five Rule, WANs, WAN vs. LAN Components. 11On-premise Priority One EquipmentWhat is it???Equipment located on the applicant’s premise is presumed to be Internal Connections.However, the FCC’s Tennessee Order establishes that this presumption can be rebutted under certain conditions as part of an end-to-end Priority One Service.12 Conditions of the Tennessee OrderThe leased on-premise equipment is an integral component of a Telecommunications or Internet Access service.The on-premise equipment will be provided by the same service provider that provides the eligible telecommunications or Internet access service of which it is a part. Responsibility for maintaining the equipment rests with the service provider, not the school or library. Ownership of the equipment will not transfer to the school or library in the future, and the relevant contract or lease does not include an option to purchase the equipment by the school or library. 13    Tennessee Order Cont’d5.	Upfront, capital charges of the eligible on-premise equipment are less than 67% of total charges (recurring plus non-recurring) in the funding year. 6.	The equipment will not be used by the school or library for any purpose other than receipt of the eligible telecommunications or Internet access service of which it is a part. 7.	The Local Area Network of the school or library is functional without dependence on the equipment. 8.	There is no contractual, technical, or other limitation that would prevent the service provider from using its network equipment in part for other customers14      On-Premise EquipmentIs it possible for this Router to be eligible as Priority One equipment?15On-Premise EquipmentIs it possible for this Router to be eligible as Priority One equipment?16On-Premise EquipmentIs it possible for this Router to be eligible as Priority One equipment?17  On-Premise EquipmentIs it possible for this Router to be eligible as Priority One equipment?18Wide Area NetworksDefinitionExclusionsWAN DiagramsAmortization19           Wide Area Networks (WANs)FCC’s definition:    A wide area network (WAN) is a voice, data, or video network that provides connections from one or more computers or networks within an eligible school or library to one or more computers or networks that are external to such eligible school or library. 20WANs Cont’dAre there any exclusions?Yes, excluded from this definition is a network that provides connections between or among buildings of a single school campus or between or among buildings of a single library outlet or branch, when those connections do not cross a public right of way. 21    Wide Area Network???22        Eligible Telecommunications WAN?23              Eligible Internet Access WAN?24Why is this Ineligible?25AmortizationEligible telecommunications services and Internet access can include service provider equipment costs and/or a non-recurring charge for capital investment by the service provider. However, in cases where the upfront or non-recurring charge is greater than $500,000, this charge must be prorated over a period of at least three years.26Cost AllocationWhy and WhenHowExamples27Cost AllocationWhy and When should I Cost Allocate?When a product or service contains ineligible components, a cost allocation may be used so that support can be provided for the eligible portion. 28Cost AllocationHow do I cost allocate? Several methods of cost allocation can be used, but they must be based on tangible criteria that provide a realistic result. 29Cost AllocationExample 1:If you are installing the following: Routers, switches, a PBX, and an ineligible Paging systemThe paging system should have the costs associated with its installation removed from the request.  This could be achieved by providing the typical number of hours it takes to install the system and the cost per hour.30Cost AllocationExample 2:Say you’re providing an eligible web-hosting and email service that contains ineligible web creation softwareIf there is no separate cost that can be removed for the web creation software the straight line method can be utilized.  Of the three services web hosting, e-mail, and software, 2/3rds are eligible, therefore 1/3rd should be removed from the request.31Cost AllocationExample 3:If a school is sharing a telephone line with their churchApplicants can submit an estimate of the percent of use at each location in order to obtain funding for the eligible portion only.  32Service SubstitutionsDefinitionRulesGlobal Service SubstitutionsFAQ’sHelpful Hints33Service SubstitutionsA service substitution is a change in the products and/or services specified in the Services Ordered and Certification Form, FCC Form 471. In certain limited circumstances, applicants or service providers may request and be approved for service substitutions. 34Global Service SubA Global service substitution can involve a product and/or service that is being discontinued, has a model number change, or is being replaced. In this case, the manufacturer or service provider may submit notification to USAC that the product or service is being changed, along with a listing of one or more replacement products or services.35         Global Service Sub FAQ’sCan I substitute anything?Service provider-initiated service substitutions are designed to accommodate replacements that USAC can substantiate are near-identical. How do I benefit from submitting a Global Service Sub?You will be paid quicker.  An Invoice with equipment different than the 471 requested equipment are rejected.  Invoices that have the new product on file will not be rejected, which means quicker payment and less additional work to re-file an invoice.36       Global Service Sub FAQ’sDo I receive any deadline extensions?Since a service provider-initiated service substitution does not reference any specific funding request, such service substitutions will not result in a change to an applicant's funding commitment, and no time extension for the completion of non-recurring services is provided under this approach.Can I specify applicants this Global sub affects?No.  You can submit a batch of individual service sub requests which MUST be signed by the applicants.Go to www.usac.org, visit the Reference Area, Service Substitutions. Relevant info is in section two.37Helpful HintsBe sure to include your contact information, e.g. Name, phone number, fax and email.If submitting multiple products, track it with a spreadsheet showing your end-of-life/replacement products.  Providing a digital copy can drastically improve processing time. manufacturerproducts@sl.universalservice.org38     The Importance of ClarityPut on your PIA reviewer shoes and tell me what you think of the following scenarios39         The Importance of ClarityScenario #1An applicant’s Priority One Service mentions equipment40      The Importance of ClarityScenario #2PIA receives a request for Dark Fiber Service with no mention of the provision of modulating electronics41      The Importance of ClarityScenario #3PIA receives a telephone bill that gives no detail but states there are other charges42SummaryKnow where your services and products fit in the Eligible Services ListComment on the ESL Understand the Special Eligibility ConditionsUtilize the ability to submit Service Substitutions if applicable Provide clear information as to what services or products you are supplying43The End44Questions???45"

81,documents/product-instructions-oven.docx,it,,"Talking Combination Oven ES7253Product InstructionsGeneral descriptionThis combination microwave oven is easy to use!Imported and converted to Australian standards. This talking microwave also includes a radiant glass element for the convection oven and grill. Use separately or in various combinations to achieve the best and most flexible cooking arrangements giving you independence in the kitchen, cooking up a storm. InstructionsInstallation1.  Remove all packing materials and accessories and retain them in case you need to return the oven to us in the future.2.  Place the oven in a level location, making sure that there is at least 30 cm of space on the top and 10 cm at the rear and sides for proper ventilation.  Exhaust outlets are located on the top and back of the oven - blocking these outlets can cause damage to the oven.3.  Ensure that the rotating ring is positioned centrally on the floor of the oven and that the turntable is located on the central pillar and sitting flat on the rotating ring.4.  Plug your oven into a standard 230 volt 13 amp household outlet. Ensure that your oven is the only appliance connected to the socket. Other appliances, particularly freezers, can generate significant interference which may disrupt the operation of the oven if they are plugged into the same double socket or the same mains wiring spur. 5.  DO NOT SWITCH THE POWER ON YET - please read the following WARNINGS & SAFETY PRECAUTIONS first!WARNINGS & SAFETY PRECAUTIONSTHIS APPLIANCE CAN GET VERY HOT WHEN USING THE GRILL OR CONVECTION OVEN. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ON TOP OF THE CASE AND TAKE CARE WHEN TOUCHING THE CASE OR DOOR. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE USE OF OVEN GLOVES. DO NOT TOUCH THE ROOF OF THE CAVITY DURING OR AFTER COOKING AS THE GRILL ELEMENT MAY BE EXTREMELY HOT. DO NOT USE PLASTIC OR FLAMMABLE CONTAINERS WITH THE GRILL OR CONVECTION OVENS OR IF THE OVEN IS STILL HOT FROM THEIR RECENT USE.This appliance must be earthed.If you need to open the oven door while cooking you should press ‘STOP’ first to pause the program. After closing the door, press ‘START’ to continue cooking.Do not place any object between the oven front face and the door or allow soil or cleaner residue to accumulate on sealing surfaces.Do not operate the oven if it is damaged.  It is particularly important that the oven door closes properly and that the door is not bent or the glass broken, that the hinges and latches are not broken or loose and that the door seals and sealing surfaces are clean and undamaged.The oven should not be adjusted or repaired by anyone other than properly qualified service personnel.Please ensure that cooking times are correctly set as over cooking may result in fire and damage to the oven.Do not dry clothes in the oven or use wooden utensils - they may burn.Do not place the turntable in water immediately after cooking - it may break.Pierce the skins of apples, potatoes etc. and do not cook eggs in their shells, to avoid bursting.Do not attempt deep fat frying in the oven.Take care when removing hot liquids from the oven.  They may be heated above their boiling point without showing bubbles and can boil violently out of the container - always leave to stand for a few minutes before opening the door.If your oven does not tell you when the door has been opened or closed or does not speak properly when in use disconnect it from the wall socket and telephone Cobolt Systems Ltd for advice before using it again.How your oven works This oven is actually three appliances in one, which can be used completely separately or together. It is a 900 watt microwave oven, a grill and a fan assisted convection oven. When used separately these operate in the same way as conventional ovens, with the addition of speech. When used in combination, particularly when using the pre-set cooking and roasting programs, they work together to enable you to cook meals in about half the time required by a conventional oven while properly browning and crisping food in a way that cannot be achieved by microwave alone.Microwave OvenMicrowaves are a form of energy similar to radio and television waves and to ordinary daylight.  Everything emits microwaves, even people, but ordinarily they spread outwards as they travel through the atmosphere and disappear without effect.  Your microwave oven is constructed to convert electricity into microwave energy by use of a magnetron tube.  These microwaves are then directed into the cooking area.  They can penetrate such materials as glass, porcelain and paper i.e. the materials out of which microwave safe cookware are manufactured but they cannot pass through the metal walls of the oven or the screen built into the door.  The microwaves heat the food by penetrating the surface and exciting the water content.  They do not heat the containers directly although these can become hot because of being in contact with the food.See the later section for information on precautions and techniques particular to microwave cooking.Grill The grill element is mounted in the roof of the oven cavity. It gets extremely hot so care must be taken not to touch it when in use. The grill rack must be used when grilling food. A plate or drip tray should be placed between the glass tray and the rack.Convection Oven The heating element for this is mounted behind the wall at the back of the oven cavity. It is not exposed but, like any fan oven, the interior walls will get very hot so take care not to touch the walls with exposed skin. This oven works by having a fan circulate air over the element then through the interior of the oven before exhausting the air through the vents. The metal rack must be used when convection cooking.Controls Your oven has a control panel on the front right face with nineteen keys arranged in eight rows.  To the left of the control panel, on the right hand side of the door, is a finger recess used for pulling the door open.  The control panel keys are arranged as shown on the next page.Keys Left to Right In Rows Top to Bottom Row 1   CLOCK, TIMERRow 2   MICROWAVE, GRILLRow 3   COMBI, CONVECTIONRow 4   AUTO DEFROST, AUTO COOK, AUTO ROASTRow 5   TEMP DOWN or LESS, TEMP UP or MORERow 6   10 MIN or 1 lb./1 kg, 1MIN or 1 oz./100 gm, 10 SECS or METRIC/IMPERIALRow 7   Three FAVOURITESRow 8   STOP/CANCEL, STARTOperating the Oven Volume Press the ‘CLOCK button. The oven will say “Clock is not set”. Keep the button pressed until the oven says “Set volume”. Release the button and use the ‘10 MIN’ and ‘1 MIN’ buttons to adjust the volume. Press ‘CLOCK’ again to fix the speech volume.Clock The clock is a standard talking clock and, unlike most ovens, you do not have to set it before you can use the appliance.Press the `CLOCK' button - the oven will say ""Clock is not set"".  Keep the button pressed until the oven says ""Set clock"".  You now use the `10 MIN' button to set the hours and the `1 MIN' button to set the minutes.  When complete press the `CLOCK' button again to fix the time. Pressing the `CLOCK' button will now give you the time and can be used whether or not the oven is operating.Timer The timer is used as a countdown timer only, or to report how long it will be before a program is complete. It cannot be used to turn the oven on or off.Press the `TIMER' button - the oven will say ""Timer only"".  The three buttons on the SIXTH row are now used to set the count-down time (The left button increases by 10 minutes, the center button by 1 minute and the right button by 10 seconds).  Pressing the `START' button now starts the timer.  Subsequent presses of the `TIMER' button will give the time remaining.  One press of the `STOP' button will pause the timer, which can then either be cancelled by a second press of the `STOP' button or re-started by pressing the `START' button.  Pressing the `LESS' or 'MORE' buttons while the timer is running will adjust the remaining time by 10 seconds for each press while pressing the ‘START‘ button will add 30 seconds for each press.  Once the selected time has elapsed a tone will sound and the oven will say ""Complete"".Pressing the 'TIMER' button while the oven is cooking will cause the remaining time to be spoken.PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TIMER WILL NOT SWITCH THE OVEN ON!General Cooking Information If at any time you press an inappropriate button the oven will say ""Incorrect key"" and will ignore the button.While cooking is in progress pressing the ‘CLOCK’ button will provide the time, pressing the ‘TIMER’ button will give the remaining cooking time, Pressing any of the seven buttons on the next three rows  will provide a reminder of the program and cooking time currently selected.If you press the `MORE' or 'LESS' buttons while cooking is in progress ten seconds will be added to, or subtracted from, the cooking time for each press of the button.  Pressing ‘START’ while cooking is in progress will add 30 seconds for each press.If you start entering powers, times, weights or begin programming a 'FAVOURITES' button but do not complete the entry, the oven will say “Cancel” after two minutes and automatically cancel the incomplete program.Cooking can be paused by pressing the ‘STOP’ button. Pressing ‘START’ will continue the cooking process. If you press ‘STOP’ at this stage the oven will ask you to confirm that you do actually want to cancel the program by pressing ‘STOP’ again.Favorites Once you become familiar with using your oven you will probably find that you use some routines regularly. You can store up to three of these, including auto cook routines, in the three ‘FAVOURITES’ buttons. To do this just set the designed routine as normal, including weight and time if required, then press a ‘FAVOURITES’ button and hold it down for five seconds, until the oven says “Favourite stored” followed by the cooking routine. To use the saved routines just press the appropriate ‘FAVOURITES’ button. The oven will remind you of the routine. Press ‘START’ to begin cooking.The ‘FAVOURITES’ buttons can be re-programmed as often as you wish and they will remember their functions even if you turn the power to the oven off.Microwave CookingPress 'MICRO' to select the microwave oven. Repeated presses will adjust the power level.  There are five powers available - high, medium-high, medium, medium-low and low. (If no power is selected the oven will assume that high power is required).Enter the required cooking time using the three buttons on the sixth row.  The left button selects from zero to 120 minutes in 10 minute steps. If you do not set a cooking time then the oven will cook for 30 seconds.The center button selects from zero to 9 minutes in 1 minute steps.The right button selects from zero to fifty seconds in 10 second steps.This means that the cooking time can be set from 10 seconds to 129 minutes 50 seconds.The power and time buttons may be pressed in any order to adjust the settings.Press the `START' button to start cooking.  The microwave will remind you of what has been set and will sound a tone and say ""Complete"" when it has finished.Quick Start Just pressing the 'START' button will instantly turn the microwave on at full power for thirty seconds.Grill Press 'GRILL' to select the grill. Enter the required grilling time using the three buttons on the sixth row. The left button sets the time in 10 minute steps, the center button in one minute steps and the right button in ten second steps. If you do not set a cooking time then the grill will operate for 30 seconds.Press 'START' to switch the grill on. The oven will remind you of what has been set and will sound a tone and say ""Complete"" when it has finished.Convection Oven Press 'CONV' to select the convection oven. The oven temperature will initially be set to 180 deg C. This can be adjusted by use of the 'MORE' and 'LESS' buttons. Enter the required cooking time using the three buttons on the sixth row. The left button sets the time in 10 minute steps, the center button in one minute steps and the right button in ten second steps. If you do not set a cooking time then the oven will preheat - see below.Press 'START' to switch the oven on.

It will sound a tone and say ""Complete, leave to stand"" when it has finished.Microwave Cooking FOOD CHARACTERISTICS AFFECTING MICROWAVE COOKINGDensity: Light, porous food such as cakes and bread cook more quickly than heavy, dense foods such as roasts and casseroles.  You should take care when cooking porous foods that the outer edges do not become dry and brittle.  It may be advisable to reduce the power level if this happens.Height: The upper portion of tall foods, particularly roasts, will cook more quickly than the lower portion.  It is wise to turn tall foods during cooking, sometimes several times.Moisture: Relatively dry foods such as roasts and some vegetables may benefit by being sprinkled with water prior to cooking or covered so as to retain steam.Bone and fat content: Bones conduct heat and large amounts of fat heat quickly so care must be taken when cooking bony or fatty cuts of meat to prevent them cooking unevenly or becoming overdone.Quantity: The greater the amount of food in the oven the longer the cooking time.Shape: Microwaves penetrate about 2.5cm into the food.  This means that the outer layer is cooked directly by the microwaves and the inside is cooked by convection as the heat travels inwards.  This means that the worst shape is a thick square - the corners will tend to cook faster than the center.Microwave Cooking Techniques Browning: Meat and poultry that is cooked for 15 minutes or longer will brown lightly in its own fat.  Foods that are cooked for a shorter period may be brushed with a browning sauce.Covering: Using a cover or dish with a lid will trap the heat and steam and cause the food to cook more quickly.  Sandwiches and foods containing pre-baked bread should be wrapped prior to microwaving to prevent them drying out.Spacing: Individual items will heat more evenly if placed in the oven an equal distance apart, preferably in a circular pattern.  It is a good idea to place thicker portions of meat, poultry and fish towards the outside of containers in order to help them to cook more evenly.  Do not stack foods on top of one another.Stirring: In conventional cooking foods are stirred for the purpose of blending.  Microwaved foods are also stirred to spread and redistribute heat.  Always stir from the outside towards the center as the outside of the food heats first.Turning: Most foods will benefit from being turned over part way through cooking in order to distribute the heat evenly.Elevating: Thick or dense foods can be elevated so that the microwaves can be absorbed by the underside of the food.Piercing: Foods enclosed in a shell, skin or membrane are likely to burst unless they are pierced prior to cooking.  Such foods include eggs, shellfish, sausages, jacket potatoes, pre-prepared meals and foods wrapped in Clingfilm or similar.Standing: Foods cook very quickly in a microwave oven but most, including meats and poultry, are removed from the oven and allowed to finish cooking while being left to stand for a few minutes.  It is usually better to cover food while it is standing in order to retain heat and moisture.Microwave Safe Utensils Never use metal or metal trimmed utensils in your oven.  Microwaves cannot penetrate metal and they will be reflected inside the cavity, often resulting in sparking inside the oven which is alarming and can lead to damage inside the oven.  Most heat resistant non metallic cooking utensils are safe for microwave use but if you are unsure about a particular item it should be tested.Testing utensils:  Place the utensil to be tested next to a bowl filled with water inside the oven.  Operate the oven at high power for 1 minute.  If the water heats up and the utensil remains cool to the touch it is safe to use in the oven.  If the water remains cool and the utensil becomes warm then it should not be used in the oven.Dinner plates:  Many kinds are microwave safe.  If in doubt consult the manufacturer's literature or test as above.  Do not attempt to warm plates in the oven if they do not have food on them.Glassware: Heat resistant glassware is safe to use.  Do not use delicate tumblers, wine glasses or similar as these are likely to shatter as their contents heat up.Paper:  Paper plates and containers are convenient and safe to use provided that the cooking time is short and the foods are low in fat and moisture.  Paper towels are useful for wrapping foods and for lining containers in which greasy foods are being cooked.  Generally avoid coloured paper products as the colours may run.Plastic containers: These should only be used to hold foods that are being quickly re-heated and only then for a very short time as hot foods will quickly melt them.Pottery, stoneware and ceramics:  These are usually safe to use in the oven but they should be tested as above before use.MICROWAVE POWER LEVEL TABLEPower		Output  	UseHIGH 		100%  	Boil WaterReheatingCook fresh fruits & VegetablesCook fishPreheat browning dishSauté onions, celery & 	peppersMEDIUM HIGH  	80% 		Roast meat & poultryCook mushroomsCook foods containing cheese & eggsMEDIUM		60% 		Bake cakes, sconesPrepare eggsCook meat, poultryCook custardPrepare rice, soupMEDIUM LOW  	40%		All thawingMelt butter & chocolateCook less tender cuts of meatsLOW 		20%			Soften butter & cheeseSoften ice creamRaise yeast doughAUTO COOK PROGRAMSPROGRAM		WEIGHT LIMITS		UTENSIL		FOOD TEMPJacket Potato	4oz - 2lb 3oz			tray			Room100g-1.0kgWash and dry medium sized potatoes.

86,documents/0-cognism-how-to-sell.pdf,sales,good,"How to Sell Without Product Differentiation: A Cognism Guidem o c m s n g o c w w w.i.In the year 2000, the marketing guru Jack Trout published his business classic, Differentiate or Die: Survival in Our Era of Killer Competition.The premise of the book is as follows: for a brand or product to survive and thrive, it must build an identity which is markedly different from its competitors.Introduction: Differentiate or Die?The term “differentiate or die” has since become a central tenet for sales and marketing teams to follow. According to Trout’s law, a business must identify its USP (Unique Selling Point) and sell off the back of that. A USP can be any factor that differentiates a product or service from its competitors - for example, the lowest cost, the highest quality, the level of customer support or simply being the first product of its kind.But, nearly 20 years after “differentiate or die” was first coined, is it still relevant? The world of business has moved on. New technologies, such as AI and machine learning, have given rise to a new generation of companies. Disruption of traditional industries is the name of today’s game. There are now more businesses than ever before - a quick look at the stats proves this:In 2016, the number of UK startups rose to a new record - 660,000 new companies were established, compared to 608,00 in 2015.In 2017, UK startups raised more money in equity investment than ever before - equalling £8.27bn worth of funding.In 2018, the number of new tech companies in the UK rose by 14%.1It’s clear therefore that business, in particular the B2B and tech sectors, is now exploding with competition. There are more startups than ever before and all of them are battling each other to win a slice of the market.How then can businesses overcome this problem and win more customers? Many of them turn to the easiest option, which is eroding their pricing integrity to attract buyers.With such fierce competition out there, what does this mean for “differentiate or die”?The truth is, when confronted with so much choice, most consumers can’t tell one product from another. You may think that your product is special and brings something new to the table - but for a buyer, it looks just the same as all the other hundreds of similar products out there. What good is a USP if it’s just going to become lost in the ocean of competition?By undercutting their rivals and offering their services for a lower price, they hope to gain a competitive advantage.But this method is ultimately unsustainable. No business that relies on reducing prices just to win business will survive for long. And what will devaluing the product do to its long-term growth potential? There is another, better way, to win.A crowded tech market – there are lots of choices for consumers.2How to Sell Without Product DifferentiationThe question that needs to be asked then is this:If product differentiation is dead, how can a company make its product or service stand out when selling?It’s still possible, although it may require a seismic shift in how you’ve done business to date.These days, you can win with how you sell, not what you sell. Forget pointless phrases and buzzwords like USP. Forget the sales and marketing jargon. Forget “differentiate or die” - you can survive without it! All you need is to refresh how your sales team conducts its business - and in this guide, Cognism will show you how it’s done - in three simple steps!1. Decrease Time to ValueTime to Value (TTV) is the amount of time it takes for a prospect to realise the value of your product. What do we mean by value?if all goes well, the prospect will move from being interested in your product to signing on as a new customer.It’s the benefit that the prospect is expecting to receive from your product.It’s not about the value you think or want your product to deliver; it’s all about the perceived value from your prospect’s perspective.In sales, the point when most prospects realise the value of a product comes during a live demonstration (demo). This is when the company’s sales rep meets with the prospect, either in person or online, to show them in real-time what the product is capable of. It’s the crucial moment when,However, too many sales reps are delivering demos which don’t produce results. The prospect isn’t converted into becoming a customer and worthwhile deals are lost. What’s the cause of this? It’s time to value.During their training, many sales reps are taught to ramp up anticipation in their demos. It’s the classic way of selling - explain features first, then show the value (“Here’s what this product can do for you!”).This is the wrong approach. It’s likely to bore your prospects and make them turn away.3The ideal length of a SaaS sales demo is 15 minutes or less - why waste time showing the prospect things they might not be interested in?Instead, flip your sales demos around. Put the last thing, your value proposition, first (“Here’s what this product can do for you. Now, if you want me to run through the features…”). Begin with the benefit your prospect will get out of using your product. Starting with the value proposition in your sales demos will impress your prospect - and make your product stand out from the competition.However, before you start, make sure you define what the value is for each prospect or customer.It will be different in each case! Consult your buyer personas and your market research. Every time, you must think to yourself: what defines success for this prospect or customer?This advice doesn’t just work for sales demos, either. You can try decreasing TTV in all of your company communications, from onboarding sessions, case studies and marketing emails. It’s a great way to differentiate your product or brand from all the other companies you’re competing with.2. Use Tribal Social ProofSocial proof is a powerful sales technique. It’s all about using the society of customers you’ve built up, in order to persuade potential customers that you’re a good fit for their needs. Some examples of social proof techniques include:Customer case studies.Customer testimonials or reviews.Influencer endorsements.However, despite its power and obvious usefulness in attracting new custom, social proof is often misapplied. In some cases, it can even harm the possibility of a deal being closed. Gong.io, the conversation intelligence platform for sales, used AI to study over 48,000 B2B sales calls. They discovered that sales reps who used social proof in their cold calls (such as repeating customer case studies or name-dropping customers) had a 22% lower close rate - plummeting to 47% during the first meeting with a new, qualified buyer.Client logos featured on your website or sales/marketing collateral.Customer quotes or references.What’s the reason for this? It’s not that social proof isn’t useful or important - it is. It’s just that many sales reps use it in the wrong way. Too often, they bring up4their most famous or biggest customer, regardless of whether that customer is relevant to the prospect they’re speaking with. There’s no point in sharing social proof if it doesn’t resonate with your prospect. In fact, it can go a long way to alienating them and making them look for a solution elsewhere.stack. You can then mention them in your cold calls and demos. This is a much more effective way of using social proof. It will make your prospect feel as if they are in the same tribe as your customer. It will show them that they, too, will find success if they join your tribe.Think about it this way.Humans are tribal creatures. We identify with other people when we share common traits or environments.Just like time to value, though, you’ll have to change the social proof to make it relevant for each prospect. When thinking of a client you want to use for social proof, ask yourself some questions:Are they like the prospect?So, in order to get the best out of social proof, you have to learn how to exploit the bonds that tie people together. You have to get tribal.Are they in the same industry?Are they the same size company as the prospect?For example - if your prospect lives in London, works in sales for a growing startup, and uses Salesforce on a daily basis, what’s the point in mentioning that valued customer of yours who’s a huge marketing multinational based in California? It has nothing to do with the life and career of your prospect. It means little to them.Are they based in the same or similar location?Have they encountered the same problems as your prospect?Do they use the same technologies to try and overcome those problems?Instead, you have to get granular and targeted with your social proof. Pick a handful of clients who are, ideally, based in London, are growing start-ups, and have Salesforce as part of their techTribal social proof will make your product stand out without product differentiation, as it will show that you’ve done your research and are working to address your prospect’s problems.6 Major Types of Social Proof53. Sell the Problem, Not the ProductYou may think that you have a great product with loads of unique features - but the prospect won’t care about any of that.All the prospect cares about is if the product will help them to solve their life or business problems.Instead of focusing on product features, a good sales rep should speak directly to the challenges that their prospect is facing.Be an educator, not a salesperson - The prospect is coming to you for help and advice. They want to learn about your product. Therefore, you have to teach them. Provide knowledge and insight. A good sales rep should know everything there is to know about a product. Also, remember to take advantage of any content or marketing collateral your company has produced. Maybe there’s a blog on your website, a white paper you’ve promoted, or a webinar you’ve hosted, that could answer your prospect’s questions. If so, don’t be shy in sharing them!How best to do this? Sell the problem, not the product. Describe what the prospect’s problem is, and then position your product as the best solution for solving that problem.Here’s some good advice to help you sell the problem:Ask questions - Asking your prospect lots of questions is a great way to build rapport with them. It shows them that you’re listening and want to address their pain points. Use open-ended questions, rather than closed-ended questions (questions that require a “yes” or “no” answer) to encourage your prospects to open up and reveal more about what they’re after.Think the way the prospect thinks - Imagine yourself in the prospect’s shoes. What does your product offer them? What do they want to gain from it? Do they have one specific goal or a multitude of goals? Are they after, for example, flexibility, security, ease of use or value for money? To make your prospect take notice, find out what’s on their mind and relate your product to them.Use customer feedback - Make sure you have some customer quotes or reviews to hand. But always ensure they are relevant to your prospect (see point 2!).Benefits, not features - Don’t just reel off a list of features. Focus on the benefits of those features. What results can the prospect expect to see after using your product? If you mention any competitors, do so in a way that makes it clear that their solution won’t solve the prospect’s problem.6Conclusion: The Cognism StoryAt Cognism, we’ve adopted these techniques in our selling. It’s partly the reason why we’ve experienced phenomenal growth recently. Just take a look at these stats:During our first year, despite minimal resources, Cognism achieved 30% growth in month-on-month revenue.In 2018, Cognism saw a 600% growth in overall revenue.In the second quarter of 2018, the company achieved a 61% increase in monthly recurring revenue (MRR).In just 18 months since startup, we have built a base of over 200 clients, including an increasing number of global enterpriseorganisations, as well as SMBs and mid-market companies.This rapid growth has led to an increase in company headcount, with a projected doubling of the sales team in the next 12 months. By focusing on how we sell, not what we sell, we have managed to listen to our customer base. Their feedback has helped us to craft a product that solves their problems. This in turn has fuelled sales and referrals for us. We’re confident that you, too, could see the same results - if you follow our advice and learn how to sell without product differentiation.

91,documents/sap-sales-overview.pdf,sales,,"Welcome to the topic on the sales process.In this topic, we will examine the basic steps in the sales process in SAP Business One. Then we will perform a streamlined sales process.2Imagine that your company has set customer satisfaction as its top priority. You review the basic steps in the sales process and decide to use a streamlined process for rush orders to ensure that customer demands can be met as quickly as possible.3(cid:132) The sales-A/R process moves from selling the goods (and services) to delivering those goods to invoicing the customer for their purchases, to the last step in accounting of receiving the incoming payment.(cid:132) Each step in the sales process involves a document, such as a sales order, delivery, or A/R invoice. SAP Business One efficiently moves all relevant information from one document to the next in the document flow. According to the business needs, you can choose which documents to include as your process steps. The only mandatory document in sales is the A/R invoice.(cid:132) Sales documents carry much of the same information throughout the sales process. This topic helps you recognize what is the same in each document so that you can quickly focus on just the information you need.(cid:132) Note that you also have the option to use a sales quotation to start the sales process.The sales quotation is not covered in this e-learning.The sales order is a commitment from a customer or lead to buy—at agreed-to quantities and price—a product or service from you.5The delivery indicates that the shipment of goods has occurred.6The A/R invoice is the only document that must be created in the sales process. It is the request for payment and records the revenue in the profit-and-loss statement.7(cid:132) The incoming payment receives the payment from the customer and clears thecustomer account. Internal reconciliation takes place automatically.(cid:132) Incoming payments are done in the Banking module.(cid:132) As part of a streamlined sales process, it is possible to post a payment while creatingthe invoice. To do this, you choose the payment means icon when you create an invoice and enter the payment amount. This will create an incoming payment due amount that is applied to the invoice you just created.(cid:132) Every document in the sales process must have a business partner assigned. Thebusiness partners used in the sales process are leads and customers. A lead can easily convert to a customer.(cid:132) A sales order can have either a lead or a customer assigned. Once you move to adelivery, you must have a customer.(cid:132) Customer master data describes people and organizations to whom your company sells products and services. Customer master data records are used as the foundation for documents related to processing and fulfilling orders for customers and for the wizard for dunning customers.(cid:132) Besides the business partner, another key piece of data entered in the sales order isitem data.(cid:132) Items represent products to be sold: either goods or services.(cid:132) Like customer master data, item information is stored in master data records.(cid:132) Services you sell can also be set up as item master data records. If the services are defined as items, they can be entered into a sales order along with physical items. Alternatively, you can use the Item/Service type field to switch to a service type document where descriptions of services can be entered along with prices.(cid:132) When you enter an item into a sales document, a price is automatically found. How doesthis work?(cid:132) SAP Business One provides 10 default price lists. You then set up prices for each price list for your items. Of course, you do not have to use all ten price lists, but they are provided to you so that you can offer different prices to different groups of customers.(cid:132) You assign a price list to each customer via default payment terms. Of course, the pricelist can be changed in the customer master.(cid:132) When you enter the customer in a sales document, the assigned price list defaults to thesales document automatically.(cid:132) The system will then use that price list to price the items in the order.(cid:132) Of course, more complex pricing can be used such as special prices, discount groups,and pricing hierarchies. These are discussed in the e-learning topic for pricing.(cid:132) Prices can also be changed in the sales order by authorized users. For example, a salesperson might give a 5% discount to a particular item or to a whole sales order.(cid:132) For our streamlined process, we will use just one document: the A/R invoice.(cid:132) The A/R invoice is the only mandatory document in the sales process. The A/R invoice is designed to be an extremely efficient document for small businesses with just a few employees.(cid:132) The A/R invoice can do the job of recording the customer’s order, kicking off the delivery,posting the goods issue and recording what the customer owes.(cid:132) Saving an A/R invoice always triggers two postings: a debit to the customer account toshow what is owed and a credit for sales revenue.(cid:132) When an inventory item is sold on an A/R invoice that has no preceding documents, two additional postings are made. These are the postings for issuing the item from inventory that are usually handled by a delivery document in a perpetual inventory system: a debit to the cost of goods sold account and a credit to the stock account.(cid:132) Of course, this graphic covers only the basic accounting transactions. There may beadditional postings for tax or additional revenues and expenses.(cid:132) The main documents of the sales process are the sales order, delivery and A/R invoice. The incoming payment at the end of the sales process is performed in the Banking module.(cid:132) Every sales document must have a business partner assigned.(cid:132) A sales document can sell goods or services. Goods are represented by item master records. If services are represented as items, they can be sold with physical items on sales documents, otherwise they are sold on service-type sales documents.(cid:132) SAP Business One calculates pricing automatically in the sales order. Prices can bechanged in sales documents by authorized users.(cid:132) The only mandatory sales document is the A/R invoice. When an A/R invoice is used alone without any preceding documents, the A/R invoice can perform the functions of the sales order, delivery and the invoice.(cid:132) This is why the A/R invoice is often used in a streamlined sales process.You have completed the topic for the sales process.

95,documents/how-to-sell-your-product.pdf,sales,,"TipConcentrate on Building RelationshipsGetting a new product listed with a retailer can be challenging. Buyers are constantly looking for new products that are on trend, however there is only so much room on the shelf. Listing a new product means that another will have to be delisted.When asked for advice on how to sell to retail most buyers say ”be persistent and concentrate on building relationships” followed closely by “do your homework”.DIRECT SALES TO RETAILERS Many small companies start by talking to independent specialty food stores or local store managers of a food chain and selling directly to the store. This approach allows familiarization of working with a retailer and getting product into local stores.The steps involved with direct sales to retailers through the owner or store manager include:Retailers have little interest in “me-too” products. You must differentiate your product from the competition. There are many ways to differentiate a product; packaging, convenience, or a company story are just a few ideas. For example there are lots of hot sauces on the market. A new hot sauce could be differentiated from the competition by using a different packaging material and telling the unique story of how the company began.1. Visit local stores and talk to store managers about selling your product in their store.2. Make the sale. 3. Deliver product. 4. Invoice the store. 5. Manage the account.a. Visit stores regularly. b. Check stock. c. Solicit orders. d. Collect accounts receivable.There are two main avenues to getting your product listed at retail: 1. Direct sales to retailers through theSALES TO RETAIL BUYER AT HEAD OFFICEowner or manager; or,2. Sales to a retail buyer at head office.Most retail chain head offices prefer that new products are listed at the chain’s head office to ensure the product is in the “system”; that it meets the retailer requirements particularly with regard to food safety and traceability and the processor gets paid.Getting an appointment to present a product to a retail buyer can be difficult. Some retailers have general contact information for new suppliers online. Store managers, food industry members and networking at industry events are other sources of buyer information.1"

It outlines your goals for the future and the tactics you'll use to achieve those goals. A sales business plan is much the same as a regular business plan except its focus is on sales and marketing — specifically, what your target market is and how you'll market and sell your product or service.Step 1Describe your target market, and be specific. Include information such as gender, age and location — whether you intend to market your product or service to local residents, residents throughout the state or nation, or through the Internet, for example. Describe why your product or service is important to your target market and how they will benefit from it. If you work for a large company, break down your target market by territory and include information about prospective customers in each territory.Step 2Discuss your marketing strategy. Include details about what your marketing budget will be, exactly how you plan to market your product or service and the sequence of the steps in your plan. This section should include information related to the promotion of the product or service — advertising and direct mail, for example. If your company is large and covers many territories, break down the marketing strategy section by territory.Step 3Explain your sales strategy and tactics. The strategy is your overall plan, and the tactics are the specific actions you'll take in order to achieve your strategy. For example, a strategy might be to increase new customers in a certain territory by 20 percent during the first quarter of the fiscal year, and one of the tactics to accomplish that might be to add an additional salesperson to that territory in order to more effectively identify prospective customers.Step 4Define your timeline in which you plan to implement your sales strategy and tactics. Break it down in whatever way makes most sense for your company and your plan. List, for example, what goals you plan to accomplish in the first 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and 180 days of the new fiscal year. Remember that these goals comprise your sales strategy.Step 5Provide an analysis of your competition. Explain the advantages of your product or service above theirs. If the competition offers benefits to the target market that you do not, it's important to identify those benefits and plan how to either change your product or service accordingly or devise a marketing and sales strategy that will rise above those challenges.Step 6Develop a sales forecast. Include sales projections month by month for at least one year, and preferably for two or three. Use historical data as a basis to project sales of an existing product or service. If you're trying to project sales for a new product or service, look at sales of a similar existing product or service sold by another company to give you some idea of the potential."
96,documents/the-selling-process-2.pdf,sales,,"ObjectivePreparing to sell No	matter	what	product	s/he	is	selling,	no	salesperson	can	sell	without	preparation.	The	first	thing	a	salesperson	must	do	is	acquire	 knowledge about the product. In some situations, this could be a lengthy and involved process. For example, insurance agents receive a	great	deal	of	education	about	their	products	and	even	go	through	a	licensing	procedure	while	they’re	acquiring	knowledge	for	selling.	 On	the	other	hand,	a	salesperson	acquiring	knowledge	about	a	restaurant’s	menu	items	may	be	able	to	do	so	sufficiently	during	a	week	 or two of training.Another	aspect	of	preparing	to	sell	is	being	able	to	identify	the	product’s	features	and	benefits.	It’s	not	enough	for	the	insurance	 salesperson to know that a certain life-insurance policy costs $350 per year. S/He must also know that this translates into a $500,000 benefit	for	the	policy’s	beneficiary	if	it	is	used.	The	restaurant	server	needs	to	know	what	comes	on	a	certain	salad	(the	salad’s	features),	 but	s/he	must	also	know	why	the	salad	is	great	for	customers	who	are	watching	their	caloric	intake	(the	salad’s	benefits).In	certain	cases,	salespeople	also	need	to	generate	and	qualify	sales	leads.	This	means	that	they	must	do	the	legwork	to	find	poten- tial customers and then determine if those customers are likely to need or want the product and have the ability to buy it. For business customers,	qualifying	a	lead	also	means	making	sure	that	your	contact	within	the	company	has	the	authority	to	make	the	purchase;	 otherwise, the salesperson can waste a lot of time. An insurance salesperson selling term life insurance would understand that the product	is	appropriate	for	customers	under	the	age	of	50.	Therefore,	s/he	would	not	qualify	customers	over	that	age	as	potential	sales	 leads	for	this	product.	A	restaurant	server,	in	contrast,	doesn’t	need	to	generate	or	qualify	leads.When	generating	and	qualifying	leads,	the	salesperson	should	try	to	learn	as	much	as	s/he	can	about	the	business	or	the	personalcharacteristics	of	the	customer.	For	example,	knowledge	of	a	company’s	size,	purchasing	practices,	location,	and	decision	makers	is	 helpful	in	understanding	its	nature.	It	can	be	of	great	benefit	to	know	how	a	 company operates. Furthermore, learning about the individuals with whom the salesperson will be in contact will aid in establishing good rapport with that customer.	The	salesperson	should	try	to	learn	the	person’s	name,	position,	 age, education, experience, hobbies, etc. Many times, just getting to know the right person at a company and “getting a foot in the door” with a sales appointment make all the difference.The	last	part	of	preparing	to	sell	is	planning	the	sales presentation. Inmany selling situations, the salesperson must have a “pitch” ready to give customers	more	information	about	the	product,	point	out	its	benefits,	and	 convince	them	to	buy.	The	salesperson	may	prepare	a	general	presentation	 that	s/he	tailors	to	fit	each	individual	customer.	The	presentation	could	be	as	 elaborate	as	a	representative	from	a	manufacturing	firm	bidding	on	a	million- dollar government contract or as simple as a hardware-store employee telling you which brand of paint is best.Establishing relationships with customers The	completion	of	a	sale	is	largely	determined	by	the	first	few	minutes	that	 a salesperson spends with his/her customers. During this time, the com- pany may gain a valuable customer for years to come or lose a customer forever. Salespeople can use their initial contact time with customers to:During the first few minutes that a salesperson spends with her customers, she should put customers at ease and determine what approach to take during the sales presentation.Put	customers	at	ease.Gain	customer	confidence.Encourage	customers	to	want	to	hear	about	the	product(s).Create	favorable	impressions	of	themselves	and	the	business.As	a	salesperson,	your	first	few	minutes	with	the	customer	also	gives	you	the	chance	to	size	up	the	customer	so	that	you	can	adjustyour	approach	to	fit	that	individual.	You’ll	soon	find	that	some	customers	are	not	actually	aware	of	their	needs,	while	others	know	ex- actly	what	they	want.	Your	job	is	to	try	to	determine	what	buying	decisions	have	been	made	by	the	customer.	To	do	this,	look	for	clues	 to the customer’s personality, including general appearance, dress, and nonverbal signs.Set Your SalesLAP-SE-126-CS © 2012, MBA Research and Curriculum Center®3"
102,documents/how-to-sell-product-pmf.pdf,hr,,"Food Safety is ParamountPRODUCT FITMake sure your product fits into the marketing mix of the retailer. For instance convenience stores focus on grab-and-go items, traditional grocery stores on affordable offerings, and health food stores on health products. If your product is a high end specialty product, concentrate on selling to stores that cater to people that are looking for that type of product.‘Local’ food products are currently on trend falling within one of the highest sought after retail categories.RETAILER REQUIREMENTS Product fit alone will not guarantee a retail listing. How you produce, package, price, distribute and promote your product must also meet retailer requirements.Many retailers have vendor requirement information online. Visit their websites and search for tabs such as: Becoming a Customer, Supplier, Partner.Keep on top of current trends as they change over time. See the Ministry of Agriculture’s guide on “How to Conduct and Use Market Research” for information on researching current trends.FOOD SAFETYFood safety is paramount to retail grocers. Most retailers require that products are produced in an approved facility. Generally, the larger the retailer, the more rigorous the food safety requirements.Large, national and multinational chains require that their suppliers have federally recognized Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) programs in place. Independent B.C. retailers may accept provincially recognized food safety programs and small local retailers may accept local health authority food safety requirements.3"

104,documents/the-selling-process-1.pdf,sales,bad,"ObjectiveThe nature of the customer.	Generally,	retail	salespeople	tend	to	spend	little	or	no	time	generating	and	qualifying	leads,	 establishing	relationships,	or	determining	customer	needs.	This	is	not	because	they	don’t	care	about	their	customers,	but	because	 customers	frequently	know	what	they	want	and	simply	desire	to	make	the	 purchase.	Customers	purchasing	frequently	bought	items	of	clothing,	such	 as	socks,	require	little	sales	assistance.	On	the	other	hand,	salespeople	who	 sell	insurance	or	flooring	may	spend	additional	time	generating	and	qualifying	 leads.	These	salespeople	may	try,	for	instance,	to	locate	families	with	newborn	 children who may need additional life insurance or new homeowners who may be in the market for carpet or tile.When	selling	to	a	business	in	an	office	or	industrial	setting,	the	time	spentin each phase, especially making initial contact and discovering needs, is likely to be far greater than in retail selling. For example, selling high-priced office	equipment	places	different	demands	on	the	selling	process.	Selling	these	 products	requires	salespeople	to	pay	additional	attention	to	locating	customers	 for these machines, to understanding the particular needs of customers, and to following up after the sale.Salespeople must understand that business customers have different buying motives than individual customers. A business customer purchases products	to	fill	specific,	black-and-white	company	needs,	whereas	a	retail	cus- tomer might purchase an item because s/he saw it and just “fell in love” with it. In	other	words,	individual	customers	fulfill	“wants”	more	often	than	businesses	 do. In addition, selling to businesses often means selling an entire group or department of people on a product, not just one individual customer as in retail selling.	It’s	not	hard	to	see	why	selling	to	businesses	generally	requires	more	 time spent in each phase than selling to retail customers.Summary There	are	similarities	as	well	as	differences	in	the	way	the	 selling process is used. All salespeople establish relation- ships with customers, discover needs and wants, recom- mend	products,	attempt	to	close	the	sale,	and	reaffirm	 relationships. However, the amount of time spent in each phase, especially preparing for the sale, varies according to the nature of the product and the nature of the customer. In general, selling to businesses takes longer than selling to retail customers.Jupiterimages/Liquidlibrary/ThinkstockJupiterimages/Photos.com/Thinkstock1. Describe at least two similarities in the use of the selling process.2. Explain how the selling process differs according to product and customer.Think about how the selling process affected the last product you bought. How did the salesperson prepare to sell you the product? How did s/he establish a relationship with you? What about discov- ering your needs and prescribing a solution? What did s/he do to close the sale? Did s/he take any steps after the sale to reaffirm a relationship with you?How can this experience teach you about the selling process for the future, when you may bethe salesperson?81375	King	Avenue,	P.O.

109,documents/to-all-members.docx,it,,"To All Sales Team Members,I'm writing this memo with a sense of deep frustration. Once again, the higher-ups have set some damn unrealistic sales targets for this quarter. It's becoming a pattern – setting us up for failure. This shit is getting out of hand. How the fuck are we supposed to meet these numbers? We're not magicians!The lack of understanding and support from management is apparent. They expect us to achieve these lofty goals without providing the necessary resources. It's stupid and demoralizing. We're doing our best, but it seems like our efforts are never enough.We need to address this issue as a team and demand reasonable targets. Otherwise, we're just being set up to fail, time and time again.Regards"

88,documents/selling-online.docx,sales,good,"Tips for selling via online marketplacesYou can set up your own web site and sell your products directly, but it can take time, effort and expense to attract users.One way of accessing a large user base straight away is to advertise your goods on an online marketplace. Online platforms such as Amazon and eBay allow businesses to advertise their goods for sale to their customer base. The platforms generally charge a fee, either for listing your products, when they are purchased, or both. Some platforms can take care of shipping and returns on your behalf, for a cost.This guide describes setting up as a seller on a typical online platform. You should research the specific services offered, the fees charged, and the amounts, before making a decision about which online platform to use.Before registering   Decide what you want to sellBefore registering, carefully consider more what you want to sell. Online selling platforms tend to divide goods into different product categories, each of which may have their own restrictions. For example, when selling fine jewellery or antiques, an online platform may wish to verify information about your business in order to satisfy themselves that the items you are selling are genuine. Choose a selling planMany online services have two or more levels of seller, typically ‘individual’ and ‘business’. If you are selling a small number of items, you may find that, even as a business, an individual plan will be more cost effective.The difference between these selling plans is often that a business plan charges a monthly subscription fee, in exchange for lower per-item fees. For example, you might see plans similar to the following:Individual Business Monthly subscription fee €0 €40 Sales fee €1 €0 Sales commission (average) 12.5% 12.5%As you can see, with this platform, you would save money by subscribing to the business plan if you were selling around 40 items per month. With this platform, the sales commission stays the same, so if you were selling 30 products at €50 per month you would pay 30 x (€1 + €50 x 0.125) = €217.50 in fees on your €1,500 sales with the individual plan, and 30 x (€50 x 0.125) = €187.50 in fees on the business plan. Understand different feesThe commission fees charged per item may vary depending on the category, usually due to the typical profit margins involved. There will usually be a minimum commission fee such as €0.50 per item. Some platforms charge a flat per-item sales fee instead of a percentage for certain categories such as media. You may wonder why these fees are charged. The reason is that you gain access to their entire customer base, which would be harder to achieve on your own. They also take care of managing your orders and you may gain access to their seller programme facilities, which could include handling customer services. Some platforms will even ship your items on your behalf. You can send them stock, which they will store for a monthly storage fee, and then send the items out on your behalf for a shipping fee. This can be convenient when you sell lots of small items, as you can take advantage of their logistics and free up the time it would take you to send large numbers of individual packages.Research the platforms operating in your region and decide on the best for your business.After registering   Create your accountIn order to start listing, you must create an account and register as a business.  ListTo list an item, it helps to know whether or not your products are already available on the platform. If they are, then listing may be as simple as indicating how many products you have to sell, describing their condition and provide shipping options.If your products are not yet on the platform, you may need to identify a Universal Product Code (UPC) or a European Article Number (EAN), and a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) number. You also need to supply product attributes like a title and a description. SellThe payment for your product, minus any fees, will usually be sent to your seller account. From there, you can make withdrawals to a bank account whenever you need to.  ShipOnce your product sells, you will be notified. If your platform offers fulfilment services then your orders will be sent out automatically. If not, you need to handle the shipping yourself. ReturnsIf the platform has fulfilled your order, they will probably also handle returns from customers. The fees and procedures involved will vary depending on your platform."

The buyers will tell you exactly what you need to have, but using Top10 or a like program and the On-Farm Food Safety Project gets you almost there.Traceability:GS1 – is an international standard for produce traceability(PTI) Produce Traceability Initiative is the coming program in CaliforniaTop10 Produce is the best option for small farmers at $280 a yearFood Safety PlanSometimes called a GAP (good agricultural practice) There are many kinds all pretty similara good one that the state certifies called California Small Farm Food Safety ManualI like the On-Farm Food Safety Project at FamilyFarmed.org    http://onfarmfoodsafety.org/Harvest schedule and estimates so you can tell a buyer what will be available and when. The ability to discuss priceDon’t be shy. If you can say when, where, and how much you will have, the buyer can give you an estimate of price. Look at the USDA Agriculture Marketing Service – Strawberries in San Francisco on February 27 were $19 to $20 a box (what a small grocer would pay)A plan to get your product to the buyerSometimes they pick up, sometimes you deliver, and sometimes you have to pay for trucking, combine with other growers, and use an aggregator. (We didn’t say this was easy!)How do you talk to the buyers here in California? If you have what the buyer wants they will not let language stand in the way. They want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to them. These buyers have great respect for growers.What you can expect from the buyer and what they expect from you:They are in a hurry and talk loud.They first want to know what you have, how much, and when it is available. Only then will they slow down for the details in your Unique Marketing Story.Buyers get right to business – They are not being impolitePhone calls will be interrupted.Telephone is OK, but a personal visit is important. Always call first for an appointment and be on time.Shake hands firmly when you meet and when you part. Be assertive and speak loudly.It does not matter what you wear or how rough your hands.If the buyer is a chef at a restaurant they will be very happy you came in, but don’t come before lunch or dinner hourThey will criticize your product – don’t be offended, listen very carefully, repeat it back to them and tell them you appreciate their advice.Don’t be embarrassed to talk about moneyNever say yes when you mean no.If you can’t deliver, or if something goes wrong – always call the buyer right awayMost important before, after, and during your time with the buyer – COMMUNICATE!Why you have to have your “Unique Marketing Story” ready when you are creating a relationship with new buyers?If you can’t say who you are, what you do, and where you are going – you will never get there. What is a Unique Marketing Story Other words for it:Elevator speechValue PropositionProfileMission StatementIt is your profile that you give to a buyerPeople want to know more about where their produce comes from.They want to buy product that is local, or Organic, grown on a small farm, or by a family, or by a Hispanic or Southeast Asian farmer.They want to know your story.Distributors and wholesale buyers are looking for ways to sell to these customers. If you want to move product through these distributors, you have to help them tell the story and make it easy for them to do business with you. What is the purpose?The purpose of a written document is to have something you can give to buyers that will make them want to keep talking to you. You don’t have to cover everything. You need a unique marketing story that is short and persuasive.What does it include?About you and your family and the place you farmWhat you grow, how much, and when will you have it to sellWhat makes your product special and why should people want to buy itHow can buyers contact youA pictureWrite you story todayUse the worksheet to help you to write your own story.

50,documents/2023-CEASampleEmployeeHandbook.doc,hr,,"SAMPLEEMPLOYEEHANDBOOKTABLE OF CONTENTSINTRODUCTIONThe California Employers Association has developed this Sample Employee Handbook for your company use.  You will be able to create or update those personnel policies best suited to your management style and current practices.  The policies included here are not the only way they can be written and the inclusion of a sample policy does not mean that a particular policy or benefit must be included in your handbook.  Detailed information relevant to the Injury Illness Prevention Program, Health Illness Prevention Program, Covid-19 Prevent Plan, or Pandemic Emergency Temporary Standards are not included in this handbook as these items should be separate documents.  CEA strongly encourages you to contact a CEA HR Director to review your handbook before you make a final draft to ensure that you have everything that is needed in your handbook.CEA strongly recommends that all employers use some form of employee handbook, which will serve as a communication tool within the organization. Employee handbooks offer you the opportunity to communicate personnel policies, employee benefits and work standards to all employees in a single publication.  They also provide valuable instruction and guidance for supervisors, managers and human resource personnel in the implementation and enforcement of company policies in a uniform and consistent manner, thus reducing the risk of unfair treatment of employees.  An employee handbook also provides a means to disseminate required policies, such as equal employment opportunity, policy against harassment and family and medical leave. By using this handbook and working with a CEA HR Director, you will be easily able to produce your own handbook for your employees.  CEA suggests that an employee handbook be given to employees only and not to job applicants.If you have any questions about any of the policies included in this publication, please consult a CEA HR Director at 1-800-399-5331 or email us at CEAinfo@employers.org.Kim GusmanPresident/CEOCalifornia Employers AssociationDISCLAIMERThe CEA Sample Employee Handbook is not intended as, nor is it a substitute for, legal advice, and any employer contemplating adopting a new policy or employee handbook, changing an existing policy or employee handbook, or with employees located in states outside of California, should feel free to consult with its own legal counsel.   Use of language provided as “Optional” may or may not be appropriate depending on the circumstances.  California Employers Association strongly suggests that users share these pages with their respective legal advisors, and confer with their attorneys and other professional advisers for specific advice concerning any contract matter.  Additionally, this employee handbook only reflects California state law.  If you have workers in any locality, localities, or other states, that impose greater or different restrictions than the state of California, you will need to incorporate those requirements in this employee handbook.  California Employers Association hereby disclaims any and all warranties and/or responsibility for the statements or their uses in construction.© 2023 California Employers Association.  All rights reserved.Employee Handbook – 2023		  	Page 9SECTION 1 WELCOME This Section Is RequiredWelcome – we are thrilled to have you join us!  We are committed to teamwork and a desire for everyone working here to be successful. One way to ensure success is for you to thoroughly read and understand our handbook. This handbook is provided for your use as a ready reference and as a summary of our personnel policies, work rules and benefits.   We have a great team, and, with you, we know it will be even better.  If you have questions, please feel free to speak to your Supervisor or Human Resource representative.Right to RevisePlease understand that this handbook only highlights our policies, practices and benefits for your personal education and cannot therefore be construed as a legal document.  Except for the employment at-will policy, we reserve the right to revise, delete or add to any and all policies, procedures, work rules or benefits stated in this handbook.  Please note that the Company also reserves the right to temporarily amend policies during a pandemic or other public health emergency. For accommodation issues, as with any other issues, please contact your supervisor.   All such revisions, deletions or additions must be in writing and must be signed by the [President, CEO, Executive Director].  No oral statements or representations can change or alter the provisions of this handbook.  You will be informed when policies, procedures, work rules or benefits are revised.  Please keep this handbook readily available and insert the updated material promptly so that it is current at all times.  Violation of PoliciesA violation of any policy whether or not detailed in this handbook will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.Nothing in this handbook will be interpreted, applied, or enforced to interfere with, restrain, or coerce you or unlawfully restrict your right to engage in any of the rights guaranteed to them by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, including but not limited to, the right to engage in concerted protected activity for the purposes of improving working conditions.Open Door Policy/Complaint ProceduresNOTE TO EMPLOYERS:  STRONGLY RECOMMENDED – EMPLOYEE ACTION HOTLINE (EAH) is a resource for your employees to report concerns relating to their employment either by phone or via an online portal. Examples include, but are not limited to: fraud, harassment, discriminatory conduct, hostile work environment issues, retaliation, workplace violence, misconduct by employees and/or supervisors, illegal activity and safety violations.  Employees can report anonymously or provide their name. The goal of the EAH is to act as a deterrent to improper conduct and also to provide an additional reporting avenue for employees. This allows you to take appropriate corrective action before the conduct worsens or results in legal action or a formal complaint against the company with the EEOC, CRD, Cal-OSHA or any other regulatory agency. In the event that a claim is filed, this reporting mechanism may serve as evidence of the employer’s’ reasonable care to prevent and correct inappropriate workplace conduct. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIRD PARTY REPORTING SYSTEM PLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION OR CONTACT CEA REGARDING THE EAH PROGRAM. We are committed to open and honest communication in the workplace. We are interested in listening to your concerns, problems, and suggestions.If you have a concern, you often will find the easiest and most effective way to find a solution is to have an honest discussion with your Supervisor.  We prefer that you follow the usual reporting channels to find a solution, starting with your immediate Supervisor, Human Resource representative or management, but we understand that there are circumstances where you may not be comfortable with the usual reporting channel. If the nature of the matter is such that you would prefer not to discuss it with a particular person, you should discuss it with the next level of management, or any other supervisor, without fear of reprisal. [Option: You may also contact the Employee Action Hotline at xxx-xxx-xxxx to report fraud, harassment, discriminatory conduct, hostile work environment issues, retaliation, workplace violence, misconduct by employees and/or supervisors, illegal activity and safety violations.  You can report via the action hotline anonymously or by providing your name.]  The objective is to maintain open and honest communication to help find a fair solution to your problems or concerns.You should immediately report any incidents of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, workplace safety violations, workers compensation abuse, potential workplace violence situations or any workplace ethic violations.Employment At-WillThis Section Is RequiredYour employment is at-will, which means that employment may be terminated with or without cause or advance notice. Terms and conditions of employment — other than employment at-will — may be modified at our sole discretion. Other than the [President, CEO, Executive Director] no one has the authority to make any agreement for employment other than for employment at-will or to make any agreement limiting our discretion to modify other terms and conditions of employment and this must be done in writing. No implied contract concerning any employment-related decision can be established by any other statement, conduct, policy or practice. Examples of terms and conditions of employment include: termination, promotion, demotion, transfers, hiring decisions, compensation, benefits and discipline.Nothing in this at-will statement is intended to interfere with your right to communicate or work with others toward altering the terms and conditions of your employment.Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation Free WorkplaceThis Section Is RequiredWe are an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.  In order to provide equal opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions are based on merit, qualifications, skills and performance.Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related setting, such as during business trips, business meetings and business-related social events.We have a strict policy against discrimination, harassment and retaliation of any type and our goal is to provide a work environment free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation as well as other disrespectful or other unprofessional conduct based on any protected class: race (including natural hairstyles), color, religion (including religious dress and grooming practices), national origin, age (40 and over), medical condition, physical or mental disability, marital status, sex (including sexual harassment, sex stereotypes and pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, reproductive health decision making, ancestry, genetic information/ characteristics, gender, gender identity, gender expression, transgender, military and veteran status, or any other characteristic or activity protected by law.

Unlawful discrimination against job applicants, employees, or unpaid interns by any of our employees is strictly prohibited.This policy governs all aspects of employment, including hiring, promotion, job assignment, compensation, discipline, access to benefits, training, termination or other aspects of employment.  Non-RetaliationIt is also prohibited for supervisors, managers and co-workers, as well as third parties such as vendors or customers, to retaliate against an employee because the employee has complained about discrimination, harassment, retaliation, abusive conduct, or participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing based on such a complaint.  Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy.Complaint ProcedureAll employees are responsible for creating and maintaining a positive work environment.    If you believe you have been a victim of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or if you have witnessed discrimination, harassment, or retaliation that violates our policy, it is important that you take steps to address it immediately so that complaints can be promptly and fairly resolved.If you are comfortable doing so, talk to the person whose behavior is bothering you and ask the person to stop. Regardless, it is imperative that you report any discrimination, harassment, or retaliation directly to your Supervisor or any member of management or human resources as soon as possible after the incident.  Please provide as many details of the incident as possible.Supervisors are required to report any incidents/complaints of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation of which they observe or become aware immediately to the [HR manager, personnel manager, President].A prompt, fair, thorough and objective investigation of the complaint will be conducted by an impartial and qualified person. Documentation will be maintained to ensure reasonable progress. The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved and, where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have other relevant knowledge.  Reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected will be reached and the complaint will be closed in a timely manner.Upon completion of the investigation, and where warranted, appropriate corrective action will be taken to eliminate the discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, or retaliation. Corrective action may include, but is not limited to, training, counseling, reassignment and/or discipline, up to and including termination. Appropriate action will also be taken to deter future conduct.To the extent possible, the investigation of a complaint and any subsequent action taken in response to the complaint will proceed in an atmosphere of confidentiality. Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the extent consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective action. Employees who have raised complaints should immediately make a further complaint should the conduct reoccur.You may also bring your complaint to the federal or state agency that investigates or prosecutes complaints.

SECTION 3BENEFITS	NOTE TO EMPLOYER: This section covering benefits is one of the most important features of any employee handbook.  This is attributable to the substantial costs of an employee benefit program, as well as enhancing positive employee relations, recruitment and retention efforts.We have made an effort here to describe the most common benefits generally afforded by the small employer.  But due to the fact that benefits are completely optional and there are many methods of computing accrual and eligibility, we can only provide you with sample language.We are pleased to provide the following benefits.  VacationWe understand the importance of balancing personal and career goals.  Therefore, we provide vacation as a benefit to eligible employees for personal time off, and vacations.

Our workforce and workplace must be free of illegal (under state and federal law) substances. (The term “illegal” includes marijuana; drugs not legally obtainable under federal or state law; prescribed drugs not legally obtained; and prescribed drugs not being used for the prescribed purposes.)  This requirement is based upon the fact that any measurable amount of an illegal drug may render you physically or mentally impaired. While we recognize your right to your own lifestyle, we will not accept the risk that on-the-job or off-the-job alcohol or drug use by you may cause or contribute to accidents or other job performance problems.Furthermore, the use or being under the influence of alcohol or of any legally obtained drugs, including marijuana, by you while performing Company business or while in our facility is prohibited. If you feel, or have been informed, that the use of a legal drug may present a safety risk, you are to report such drug use to your Supervisor.In order to provide you with some guidance concerning unacceptable behavior, we strictly prohibit the following:Possession, use, or working under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, and/or an illegal substance.Distribution, sale, dispensing, manufacture or purchase of illegal controlled substances or controlled substances used in an illegal way at the worksite.Driving a Company vehicle at any time, or your personal vehicle on Company business, while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or an illegal substance.The use of, or working under the influence of, any controlled substance, including prescription or over-the-counter drugs, if such use or influence may affect the safety of co-workers, members of the public, your job performance or the safe or efficient operation of our facility.If you violate the above rules and standards of conduct, we may bring the matter to the attention of appropriate law enforcement authorities.If you have chemical dependencies (alcohol or drugs), we will encourage you to seek treatment and/or rehabilitation. To this end, if you desire such assistance you should request a treatment or rehabilitation leave.[Employers with 25 or More Employees include]: We will reasonably accommodate an employee who wishes to participate in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program. At no time will we discriminate, harass, or retaliate in any way against you for making your request.If you are unable to perform your duties, or cannot perform the duties in a manner which would not endanger your health or safety or the health or safety of others, because of your current use of alcohol or drugs, you may be subject to discipline, without regard to your eligibility for a leave of absence.Reasonable Suspicion TestingYou will be tested for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol if reasonable suspicion exists to indicate that your ability to perform your work or to work safely may be impaired. Also, if there is reasonable suspicion of your possession, distribution, dispensing, manufacture of illegal drugs, or usage of alcohol or illegal drugs at the workplace, reasonable suspicion testing will be required.If you fail the drug test and/or have alcohol present at the levels set forth by us or if you refuse or otherwise fail to comply with the required suspicion-based testing process you will be subject to immediate suspension followed by termination of employment.Medical MarijuanaThe possession of a medical marijuana card will not insulate you from negative consequences for violating the provisions of this section.Recreational MarijuanaMarijuana is still an illegal drug under federal law and all  provisions of this policy apply to its use, regardless of its legality under any state law. Cannabidiol (CBD) products are not regulated by the FDA and they have no meaningful guarantee of what’s in the supplement. In other words, if you use CBD products you need to know you are using them at their own risk – if THC turns out to be present, you will violate this policy.Off-the-Job ConductBased on the judgment of management regarding the circumstances of the case, you may be referred for treatment/rehabilitation rather than subjecting you to disciplinary action for violation of this policy.Rehire Following Termination for Substance AbuseIf your employment is terminated for violation of the policy, you may be considered for rehire after one year following termination and upon providing competent written medical opinion attesting to your full recovery from drug/alcohol abuse.Workplace ViolenceWe do not tolerate threats or acts of violence in the workplace, and workplace security is an integral part of our Injury and Illness Prevention Program.

An employer may complete Form I-9 before the first day of employment if the employer has offered the individual a job and the individual has accepted.Employers cannot specify which document(s) employees may present from the Lists of Acceptable Documents, found on the last page of Form I-9, to establish identity and employment authorization. Employees must present one selection from List A OR a combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C. List A contains documents that show both identity and employment authorization. Some List A documents are combination documents. The employee must present combination documents together to be considered a List A document. For example, a foreign passport and a Form I-94 containing an endorsement of the alien's nonimmigrant status must be presented together to be considered a List A document. List B contains documents that show identity only, and List C contains documents that show employment authorization only. If an employee presents a List A document, he or she should not present a List B and List C document, and vice versa. If an employer participates in E-Verify, the List B document must include a photograph.In the field below the Section 2 introduction, employers must enter the last name, first name and middle initial, if any, that the employee entered in Section 1. This will help to identify the pages of the form should they get separated.Employers or their authorized representative must:1. Physically examine each original document the employee presents to determine if it reasonably appears to be genuine and to relate to the person presenting it. The person who examines the documents must be the same person who signs Section 2. The examiner of the documents and the employee must both be physically present during the examination of the employee's documents.2. Record the document title shown on the Lists of Acceptable Documents, issuing authority, document number and expiration date (if any) from the original document(s) the employee presents. You may write ""N/A"" in any unused fields. If the employee is a student or exchange visitor who presented a foreign passport with a Form I-94, the employer should also enter in Section 2:a. The student's Form I-20 or DS-2019 number (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System-SEVIS Number);and the program end date from Form I-20 or DS-2019.3. Under Certification, enter the employee's first day of employment. Temporary staffing agencies may enter the first day the employee was placed in a job pool. Recruiters and recruiters for a fee do not enter the employee's first day of employment.4. Provide the name and title of the person completing Section 2 in the Signature of Employer or Authorized Representative field.5. Sign and date the attestation on the date Section 2 is completed.6. Record the employer's business name and address.7. Return the employee's documentation.Employers may, but are not required to, photocopy the document(s) presented. If photocopies are made, they should be made for ALL new hires or reverifications. Photocopies must be retained and presented with Form I-9 in case of an inspection by DHS or other federal government agency. Employers must always complete Section 2 even if they photocopy an employee's document(s). Making photocopies of an employee's document(s) cannot take the place of completing Form I-9. Employers are still responsible for completing and retaining Form I-9.Form I-9 Instructions 03/08/13 NPage 3 of 9Unexpired DocumentsGenerally, only unexpired, original documentation is acceptable. The only exception is that an employee may present a certified copy of a birth certificate. Additionally, in some instances, a document that appears to be expired may be acceptable if the expiration date shown on the face of the document has been extended, such as for individuals with temporary protected status. Refer to the Handbook for Employers: Instructions for Completing Form I-9 (M-274) or I-9 Central (www.uscis.gov/I-9Central) for examples.ReceiptsIf an employee is unable to present a required document (or documents), the employee can present an acceptable receipt in lieu of a document from the Lists of Acceptable Documents on the last page of this form. Receipts showing that a person has applied for an initial grant of employment authorization, or for renewal of employment authorization, are not acceptable. Employers cannot accept receipts if employment will last less than 3 days. Receipts are acceptable when completing Form I-9 for a new hire or when reverification is required.Employees must present receipts within 3 business days of their first day of employment, or in the case of reverification, by the date that reverification is required, and must present valid replacement documents within the time frames described below.There are three types of acceptable receipts:1. A receipt showing that the employee has applied to replace a document that was lost, stolen or damaged. The employee must present the actual document within 90 days from the date of hire.2. The arrival portion of Form I-94/I-94A with a temporary I-551 stamp and a photograph of the individual. The employee must present the actual Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551) by the expiration date of the temporary I-551 stamp, or, if there is no expiration date, within 1 year from the date of issue.3. The departure portion of Form I-94/I-94A with a refugee admission stamp. The employee must present an unexpired Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) or a combination of a List B document and an unrestricted Social Security card within 90 days.When the employee provides an acceptable receipt, the employer should:1. Record the document title in Section 2 under the sections titled List A, List B, or List C, as applicable.2. Write the word ""receipt"" and its document number in the ""Document Number"" field. Record the last day that the receipt is valid in the ""Expiration Date"" field.By the end of the receipt validity period, the employer should:1. Cross out the word ""receipt"" and any accompanying document number and expiration date.2. Record the number and other required document information from the actual document presented.3. Initial and date the change.See the Handbook for Employers: Instructions for Completing Form I-9 (M-274) at www.uscis.gov/I-9Central for more information on receipts.Section 3. Reverification and RehiresEmployers or their authorized representatives should complete Section 3 when reverifying that an employee is authorized to work. When rehiring an employee within 3 years of the date Form I-9 was originally completed, employers have the option to complete a new Form I-9 or complete Section 3. When completing Section 3 in either a reverification or rehire situation, if the employee's name has changed, record the name change in Block A.For employees who provide an employment authorization expiration date in Section 1, employers must reverify employment authorization on or before the date provided.Form I-9 Instructions 03/08/13 NPage 4 of 9Some employees may write ""N/A"" in the space provided for the expiration date in Section 1 if they are aliens whose employment authorization does not expire (e.g., asylees, refugees, certain citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or Palau). Reverification does not apply for such employees unless they chose to present evidence of employment authorization in Section 2 that contains an expiration date and requires reverification, such as Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document.Reverification applies if evidence of employment authorization (List A or List C document) presented in Section 2 expires. However, employers should not reverify:1. U.S. citizens and noncitizen nationals; or2. Lawful permanent residents who presented a Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551) for Section 2.Reverification does not apply to List B documents.If both Section 1 and Section 2 indicate expiration dates triggering the reverification requirement, the employer should reverify by the earlier date.For reverification, an employee must present unexpired documentation from either List A or List C showing he or she is still authorized to work. Employers CANNOT require the employee to present a particular document from List A or List C. The employee may choose which document to present.To complete Section 3, employers should follow these instructions:1. Complete Block A if an employee's name has changed at the time you complete Section 3.2. Complete Block B with the date of rehire if you rehire an employee within 3 years of the date this form was originally completed, and the employee is still authorized to be employed on the same basis as previously indicated on this form. Also complete the ""Signature of Employer or Authorized Representative"" block.3. Complete Block C if:a. The employment authorization or employment authorization document of a current employee is about to expire andrequires reverification; orb. You rehire an employee within 3 years of the date this form was originally completed and his or her employment authorization or employment authorization document has expired. (Complete Block B for this employee as well.)To complete Block C:a. Examine either a List A or List C document the employee presents that shows that the employee is currentlyauthorized to work in the United States; andb. Record the document title, document number, and expiration date (if any).4. After completing block A, B or C, complete the ""Signature of Employer or Authorized Representative"" block, including the date.For reverification purposes, employers may either complete Section 3 of a new Form I-9 or Section 3 of the previously completed Form I-9. Any new pages of Form I-9 completed during reverification must be attached to the employee's original Form I-9. If you choose to complete Section 3 of a new Form I-9, you may attach just the page containing Section 3, with the employee's name entered at the top of the page, to the employee's original Form I-9. If there is a more current version of Form I-9 at the time of reverification, you must complete Section 3 of that version of the form.What Is the Filing Fee?There is no fee for completing Form I-9.
