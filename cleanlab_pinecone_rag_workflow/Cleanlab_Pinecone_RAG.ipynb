    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique in natural language processing that combines the strengths of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. RAG systems enhance the capabilities of AI models by allowing them to access and utilize relevant information from a curated knowledge base, leading to more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware responses. Building a reliable, curated, and accurate RAG system is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy:** By retrieving relevant information, RAG systems can provide more precise and factual responses.\n",
    "- **Reduced Hallucinations:** Access to external knowledge helps minimize the risk of AI models generating false or inconsistent information.\n",
    "- **Adaptability:** RAG systems can be easily updated with new information without retraining the entire model.\n",
    "- **Trustworthiness:** The ability to trace responses back to source documents enhances explainability and trust in AI-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to build such a system using [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/) and Pinecone.\n",
    "Cleanlab is a company that specializes in data-centric AI, focusing on improving the quality and reliability of AI/ML systems. Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) is designed to add trust and reliability to AI model outputs and indicate when it's unsure of an answer, making it ideal for applications where unchecked hallucinations could be problematic. This is especially the case for anyone trying to build generative AI applications in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pinecone, as a vector database solution, excels in storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors, making it perfect for managing and querying large-scale document embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Cleanlab's TLM with Pinecone's vector database capabilities, we can create a RAG system that not only retrieves relevant information efficiently but also ensures the quality and reliability of the data being used. This notebook will guide you through the process of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Cleanlab's TLM to tag and clean document data, removing low-quality chunks and personally identifiable information (PII).\n",
    "2. Leveraging Pinecone to create and manage a vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings.\n",
    "3. Implementing a RAG pipeline that uses both tools to provide accurate and trustworthy responses.\n",
    "4. Utilizing Cleanlab's TLM to classify metadata, enhance retrieval, and evaluate the trustworthiness of RAG outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a robust understanding of how to build a RAG system that prioritizes reliability, curation, and accuracy, setting a strong foundation for developing trustworthy AI applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "We used Pinecone to create the DB to actually store our document data and help us create accurate metadata to label our documents/chunks. We used Pinecone to create the vector database, actually store our chunks of document data/metadata, and as our similarity search engine - which all play a crucial part in the storage/retrieval components of RAG. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) to first tag our document chunks and then ensure no badly chunked data or PII exists in the vector DB in order to curate more accurate and reliable documents. This ensures that, during retrieval from the RAG system, only the most relevant subset of  documents is considered. Lastly, we used TLM to classify metadata for use in retrieval and used TLM to show how to get trustworthiness scores for RAG Outputs to eliminate hallucinations and nonsensical answers.\n",
