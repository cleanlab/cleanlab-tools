It is your responsibility to back up any important data before this date. (2) All pending charges for services rendered up to the cancellation date will remain due and payable, and failure to settle these charges may result in additional fees. (3) Any active warranties or service guarantees that were applicable under your account will become null and void upon the effective cancellation date. (4) By canceling, you forfeit access to all promotional benefits, loyalty rewards, or other incentives previously applied to your account, and any accumulated points or credits will also be forfeited. (5) Our team will no longer be able to provide support for retrieving data, reactivating prior settings, or addressing issues related to the service post-cancellation. (6) Re-enrollment following cancellation will be treated as a new account registration, and any prior status, discounts, or service history may not be reinstated. Please review the full policy on our website for complete details. By choosing to continue, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these terms in their entirety.' Customer: That’s really thorough! I understand the terms. Let’s go ahead with the cancellation. Agent: Thank you for confirming. I’ll schedule your cancellation for the end of your current billing period. Please let us know if there’s anything else we can assist with before then!\"}\n",
