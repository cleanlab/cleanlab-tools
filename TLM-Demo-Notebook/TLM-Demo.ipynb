    "### Additional Arguments\n",
    "- **model** (str, default = \"gpt-4o-mini\"): underlying LLM to use (better models will yield better results). Models currently supported include \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\", \"gpt-4\", \"gpt-4o\", \"claude-3-haiku\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **max_tokens** (int, default = 512): the maximum number of tokens to generate in the TLM response. This number will impact the maximum number of tokens you will see in the output response, and also the number of tokens that can be generated internally within the TLM (to estimate the trustworthiness score). Higher values here can produce better (more reliable) TLM responses and trustworthiness scores, but at higher costs/runtimes. If you are experiencing token limit errors while using the TLM (especially on higher quality presets), consider lowering this number. This parameter must be between 64 and 512.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **num_candidate_responses** (int, default = 1): how many alternative candidate responses are internally generated by TLM. TLM scores the trustworthiness of each candidate response, and then returns the most trustworthy one. Higher values here can produce better (more accurate) responses from the TLM, but at higher costs/runtimes (and internally consumes more tokens). This parameter must be between 1 and 20. When it is 1, TLM simply returns a standard LLM response and does not attempt to improve further.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **num_consistency_samples** (int, default = 8): the amount of internal sampling to evaluate LLM-response-consistency. This consistency forms a big part of the returned trustworthiness score, helping quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with strange prompts or prompts that are too vague/open-ended to receive a clearly defined 'good' response. Higher values here produce better (more reliable) TLM trustworthiness scores, but at higher costs/runtimes. This parameter must be between 0 and 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **use_self_reflection** (bool, default = True): whether the LLM is asked to self-reflect upon the response it generated and self-evaluate this response. This self-reflection forms a big part of the trustworthiness score, helping quantify aleatoric uncertainty associated with challenging prompts and helping catch answers that are obviously incorrect/bad for a prompt asking for a well-defined answer that LLMs should be able to handle. Setting this to False disables the use of self-reflection and may produce worse TLM trustworthiness scores, but will reduce costs/runtimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **log** (List[str], default = []): optionally specify additional logs or metadata to return. For instance, include \"explanation\" here to get explanations of why a response is scored with low trustworthiness.\n"
