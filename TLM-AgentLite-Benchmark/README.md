# TLM-AgentLite-Benchmark

This folder contains our results and code to reproduce the plots in our AgentLite benchmark. #TODO: Add link to blog post

Go to [TrustworthyAgentLite](https://github.com/cleanlab/TrustworthyAgentLite)(our fork of AgentLite) to run our benchmark yourself.

- Use the `grade_agent_responses.ipynb` notebook to grade the agents' responses using a modified version of OpenAI's SimpleQA grading template.
- Use the `plot_agent_performance.ipynb` notebook to reproduce the plots in our blog post.
